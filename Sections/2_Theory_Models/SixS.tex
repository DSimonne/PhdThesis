\subsection{Intensity of a Bragg peak}
Neglecting absorption, the intensity of a Bragg peak $I_{nuc}$ as a function of its Miller indices \textit{hkl} and of $2\theta$ can be written as:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:PeakIntensity}
    I_{nuc} = A \times |F_{hkl}|^2  \times j_{hkl} \times L(2\theta) \times \exp{(-2W)}
\end{equation}
where A is an instrument constant.
