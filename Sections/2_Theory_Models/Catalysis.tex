\section{Heterogeneous Catalysis}\label{sec:Catalysis}

\textit{
A catalyst is a substance that speeds up a chemical reaction, or lowers the temperature or pressure needed to start one, without itself being consumed during the reaction.
Catalysis is the process of adding a catalyst to facilitate a reaction.
}

Chemical reactions involve the breaking, rearranging, and rebuilding of bonds between atoms in molecules, resulting in the formation of new molecules.
Catalysts play a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency of these reactions by providing an alternative route for the reaction with a lower \textit{activation energy} $E_a$, the minimum energy that must be attained for the reaction to take place.
This process facilitates the breaking and formation of chemical bonds, increasing the reaction rate \parencite{Schlogl2015, Hagen2016}, described by the rate equation (eq. \ref{eq:RateEquation}) as a function of the rate constant $k$, the reactant concentration $[A]$, $[B]$ and the order of reaction $a, b$ which refers to how the concentration of the reactants affects the rate of the reaction.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:RateEquation}
    \text{rate} = k [A]^a [B]^b
\end{equation}

The impact of changing the temperature $T$ of the reaction and the activation energy is directly set in the rate constant defined by the Arrhenius equation (eq. \ref{eq:RateConstant}), $R$ is the gas constant.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:RateConstant}
    k \propto e^{\frac{-E_a}{RT}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Mechanisms}

Heterogeneous catalysis is a type of catalytic process where the catalyst exists in a different phase (solid, liquid, or gas) from the reactants.
Most commonly, the catalyst is in the solid phase, while the reactants are in either the gas or liquid phase.
This distinction sets heterogeneous catalysis apart from homogeneous catalysis, where the catalyst and reactants are in the same phase.
One of the key advantages of heterogeneous catalysis is the ease of catalyst separation and reuse.
Since the catalyst is in a different phase, it can be easily separated from the reaction mixture once the reaction is complete.
This makes the catalyst recyclable and economically attractive for industrial processes \parencite{Fechete2012}.

There are a few key parameters to take into account when comparing the efficiency and performance between different catalysts \parencite{Boudart1995, Zhang2019, Wachs2022}.
The \textit{turnover frequency} (TOF) refers to the number of reactant molecules catalysed into product molecules by a single catalyst site per unit of time, expressed in units of moles of product formed per second per mole of active catalyst site, it is an indicator of the catalyst activity.
The \textit{turnover number} (TON) refers to the total number of reactant molecules that are converted into product molecules by a single catalyst site over the entire course of a reaction, and provides a measure of the catalyst's overall \textit{activity} and \textit{stability} before deactivation.
Finally, the \textit{selectivity} of the catalyst refers to its ability to favour the formation of a specific product or products over undesired products.

Developing a catalyst that simultaneously fulfils all the desired requirements of high stability, selectivity, and activity for every chemical reaction remains an ongoing scientific pursuit \parencite{Hagen2016}.

The Sabatier principle, at the origin of the Nobel price of chemistry of 1912 \parencite{Che2013}, states that when a heterogeneous catalyst is used, there exists an optimum catalyst binding energy for the reactant on the catalyst surface.
On one hand, if the catalyst binding energy is too weak, the reactant molecules do not adsorb strongly enough on the catalyst, leading to low reaction rates.
On the other hand, if the catalyst binding energy is too strong, the reactant molecules bind too tightly and do not easily react with the other reactant, resulting in low selectivity and efficiency.
Moreover, if the adsorption is too strong, the product of the reaction is not able to desorb from the active site.

\end{figure}

In a founding study in \cite*{Langmuir1922}, Langmuir detailed the possible mechanisms of actions for heterogeneous catalysis.
When studying bi-molecular reactions, the Langmuir–Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal mechanisms are two main mechanisms of interest \parencite{Bratan2022}.
In the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism, both reactants are adsorbed in nearby sites at the surface of the catalyst, and react on the surface to form the product which is subsequently desorbed from the surface \parencite{Prins2018, ROSS2019}.
In the Eley–Rideal mechanism, a reactant in the gas phase comes and interacts with the adsorbed reactant without being itself adsorbed, followed by the desorption of the product \parencite{Rideal1939, Weinberg1996}  (fig. \ref{fig:Mechanisms}).

% In the third mechanism, an atom from the surface layer of the catalyst reacts with an adsorbed reactant, which creates a vacancy in his original position on the surface when the products is desorbed.
% The vacancy is then replaced by an atom that comes from from the bulk or the gas phase \parencite{MARS1954, Doornkamp2000}.
% This is called the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism.

The Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism seems to be generally preferred, the bonding of the reactant molecule to the atoms weakening its bonds and preparing the molecule for reaction by reducing the activation energy required for the reaction to occur \parencite{Baxter2002}.

The complete heterogeneous catalytic reaction consists in a series of elementary steps such as reactant dissociation, adsorption, surface diffusion, surface chemical reactions, and desorption that are nowadays extensively studied \textit{via} different theoretical computing methods such as density-functional theory (DFT - \cite{Reuter2004, Molenbroek2009, Yawei2015, Gaggioli2019, Chatelier2020}) or more recently machine learning \parencite{Kitchin2018, Schlexer2019, Anstine2023} as a function of the reaction parameters.

Due to the increase of interest in the field of catalysis, synchrotron techniques have been developed to study the reaction in \textit{operando} conditions, meaning that the reaction happens while being observed \parencite{Meirer2018}.
The first step towards the use of these experimental methods is to understand what specific signatures on the working catalyst can be identified using an x-ray probe.

\subsection{Active sites in heterogeneous catalysis}

Heterogeneous catalysis being a surface process, the tendency is to use small particles which maximise the surface area to volume ratio, increasing the number and variety of available active sites for catalysis, while favouring the emergence of edges and corners \parencite{Zambelli1996, Hendriksen2010, Vogt2022}.
This statement is at the origin of the push towards ever smaller samples for heterogeneous catalysis, by controlling and investigating their shape \parencite{Lee2006, Tian2007, Bratlie2007, Lee2009}, bringing forward nanoparticle catalysis \parencite{Che1989, Raimondi2005, Arico2005, Molenbroek2009, VanSanten2010, Schauermann2013}.
As an example, platinum (Pt) nanoparticles (NPs) are of great interest for the petrochemical industry \parencite{Astruc2005}, fuel cell technology and for automobile exhaust gas purification \parencite{Heck2001}.
The formation of surface oxides on specific facets of Pt-Rh nanoparticles has also been correlated with an increased activity during the oxidation of \ce{CO} \parencite{Hejral2018}.

The surface of nanoparticles can be understood as constituted of facets (fig. \ref{fig:Samples}) whose crystallographic orientation depends on the nanoparticle synthesis route, its size, and on the absence (Wulff construction) or not (Winterbottom construction) of substrate \parencite{Winterbottom1967, Boukouvala2021}.
The orientation and structure of each facet on the nanoparticle surface, described by its Miller (hkl) indices, has been shown to have a key role in the surface strain field and in the adsorption properties of the catalysts \parencite{Zhou2012, Wu2017, Wu2021}.
Between facets are the nanoparticle edges and corners, notorious for being very favourable adsorption sites due to a low local coordination geometry \parencite{Huang2008, Jiang2009}.
\cite{CalleVallejo2014}, \cite*{CalleVallejo2015}, \cite*{CalleVallejo2018} have used density functional theory (DFT) to show an approximate linear trend between the generalised coordination number $\bar{CN(i)}$ of a nanoparticle surface atom $i$ with $n_i$ neighbours (eq. \ref{eq:CN}) and its adsorption properties.
The \textit{Taylor ratio} translates this effect by defining the fraction between active sites and the total exposed surface \parencite{Taylor1925}.
\textcolor{Important}{CalleVallejo2023?}

\begin{equation}
    \bar{CN(i)} = \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} \frac{cn(j) n_j}{cn_{max}}
    \label{eq:CN}
\end{equation}
where \textit{cn} is the usual coordination number.%, \textit{i.e.} the number of neighbouring atoms.

However, strong adsorption sites are not always the most active sites, following the Sabatier principle, it is possible that if the adsorption is too strong, there is no subsequent desorption of the reaction product \parencite{Nilsson2005, Jiang2009}.

The activity of single facets can also be studied with \textit{single crystals}, much larger crystals, synthesised in a way so that their macroscopic surface consists of a single crystallographic plane (fig. \ref{fig:Samples}).

\subsection{Linking strain and reactivity}

In addition to shape-dependent catalytic activ- ity, lattice strain14 has a considerable influence on the reactivity of metal surfaces. By modifying the distances between surface atoms, tensile or compressive lattice strain induces an upward or down- ward shift of the d-band centre15, resulting, respectively, in a strengthening or weakening of the bonding to adsorbed reacting species. In platinum (Pt) for instance, a 1\% tensile (compressive) strain can upshift (downshift) the 5d-band by as much as ~ 0.1 eV16, dramatically affecting the surface reactivity17 and in turn the catalytic activity (dupraz)

ALSO OF IMPORTANCE IS THE COORDINATION NUMBER

A modern theoretical approach to the interaction between surface and adsorbates in heterogeneous catalysis has been proposed by Hammer, Norskov and Mavrikakis \parencite*{Hammer1995, Mavrikakis1998, Hammer2000} for transition metals, which is at the origin of the strain-reactivity studies in the frame of this thesis.

In a crystalline lattice, the energy levels of electrons are so close that they form bands \parencite{Ashcroft76}, the study considers that the energy levels of the \textit{d}-bands in transition metals is responsible for bonding and adsorption in catalytic reactions, the main conclusion being that there is a direct relation between lattice strain, adsorption energy and surface reactivity, which has been confirmed by later studies \parencite{Jakob2001, Kitchin2004, Kibler2005, Gsell1998, Ontaneda2015, Weissmuller2019}.
Moreover, d-bands narrowing effect also justifies the difference between bulk, surfaces steps and kinks in terms of reactivity \parencite{Haydock1972, Desjonqueres1975, Egelhoff1987, Hammer2006, Khorshidi2018}.
\textcolor{Important}{Check ref CA, also d-band centre ?, write more about scaling reactions, surface strain etc}

Two parameters are of key importance when investigating the role of the nanoparticle structure in its catalytic activity and selectivity, the link between particle shape/size and the type of facets, edges and corners exhibited on the surface, and the importance of the strain field in the adsorption of molecules participating in the reaction \parencite{Abuin2019}.

The application of this approach has been demonstrated by Wang et al. in \cite*{Wang2016}, which pionereed scientific studies for strain engineering in catalysis \parencite{NilssonPingel2018}, probed with techniques sensitive to the catalyst structure \parencite{Somorjai1991}, \textit{i.e} to the lattice strain if the resolution is good enough, such as surface x-ray diffraction \parencite{Resta2020a}, and Bragg coherent diffraction imaging \parencite{Sneed2015, Ulvestad2016, Kim2019, Bjorling2019, Passos2020, Carnis2021a, Carnis2021b, Dupraz2022} in which strain has been proven to impact the catalytic properties of the catalyst.
