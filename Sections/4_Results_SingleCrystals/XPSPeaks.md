title = {High coverage states of oxygen adsorbed on Pt(100) and Pt(111) surfaces},

Pt (111)
	O1s peak around 530.8 eV

NO adsorption on Pt(111)
	O1s: 530.6 NO bridge low coverage,

Exposure to NO on Pt (100)
	N1s: 398.1 (NOad) and 401.3 eV (Noad but different site ?)
	O1s: two peaks near 527.7 and 529.5, respectively only Oad and (NOad, Oad)

Dissociation of NO happens on surface because they see N2 and O2
At high temp only Oad peaks

Also NO adsorption, Pt (111)
	adsorbed O: 529.9

N1s not sensitive to adsorption sites bc only one peak

NO causes maximum of Pt4f peak to shift from 71 ev to higher values, 71.6
lot of site discussion depending on coverage
