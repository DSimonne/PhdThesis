\section{Pt(111) single crystal studied at \qty{450}{\degreeCelsius}} \label{sec:SXRD111}

Platinum crystallises in a face-centred cubic structure with a lattice parameter $a_{Pt}$ equal to \qty{3.92}{\angstrom} at room temperature \parencite{Waseda1975}.
Its structure was first presented in sec. \ref{sec:ScatCrystal} to introduce the notions of crystals.
The arrangement of the Pt atoms on the (111) surface is hexagonal, which leads to the definition of the surface unit cell shown in fig. \ref{fig:SurfaceUnitCellPt111} to better represent the surface arrangement of the Pt atoms.
The in-plane vectors $\vec{a}_{(111)}$ and $\vec{b}_{(111)}$ are of equal magnitude ($a_{Pt} / \sqrt{2} = \qty{2.77}{\angstrom})$, separated by \ang{120}.
The out-of-plane vector $\vec{c}_{(111)}$ is perpendicular to the (111) plane, and of magnitude $a_{Pt} \sqrt{3} = \qty{6.79}{\angstrom}$.
The stacking of the Pt layers perpendicular to the $\vec{c}$ axis follows a ABCA arrangement, \textit{i.e.} Pt atoms occupy the same positions in the $\vec{a}, \vec{b}$ plane every three layers.

\subsection{Oxide growth under 80 mbar of oxygen}

To identify the presence of surface reconstructions and/or surface oxides, in-plane reciprocal space maps were collected at the atmospheres detailed in tab. \ref{tab:ConditionsSXRD}.
This was done by rotating the in-plane sample and detector angles ($\mu$ and $\gamma$) from \ang{0} to \ang{120} to collect a third of the reciprocal space in the ($\vec{q}_x$, $\vec{q}_y$) plane, while keeping the out-of-plane detector angle $\delta$ at a constant value.
The incident angle $\beta$ was kept at \ang{0.3}.

The reciprocal space in-plane maps and rods were computed in ($hkl$)-space (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt111A} and \ref{fig:MapsPt111B}) to visualise the arrangement of surface structures or surface relaxations in comparison with the hexagonal surface unit cell described in fig. \ref{fig:SurfaceUnitCellPt111}.

        Reciprocal space in-plane maps collected under different atmospheres at \qty{450}{\degreeCelsius}, computed using the hexagonal lattice of Pt(111).
    }
    \label{fig:MapsPt111A}
\end{figure}

The first map was collected at low pressure (\qty{<1e-7}{\milli\bar}) after the cleaning of the sample by sputtering and annealing (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt111A} - a).
The (110) and (2$\bar{1}$0) Bragg peaks can be observed, together with the intersection of the [0, 1, L], [0, 2, L], [1, $\bar{1}$, L], [1, 0, L], and [2, 0, L] CTRs with the [H, K, 0] plane (circled in white).
No additional signal can be observed when introducing \qty{500}{\milli\bar} of argon in the reactor (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt111A} - b).

New peaks can first be observed under \qty{80}{\milli\bar} of oxygen, identified by different colour circles in fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt111A} (c), the corresponding interplanar spacings are given in app. \ref{tab:InterplanarSpacingsPt111Oxygen}.
The angle between the peaks circled in grey and white, and the peaks circled in red and purple is approximately equal to \ang{60}.
This could be the signature of the existence of two hexagonal surface structures, each one rotated by \ang{\pm 8.8} with respect to the Pt(111) surface unit cell and with a larger in-plane lattice parameter (drawn in green and grey in fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt111A} - c, d).
However, no apparent second order peak can be linked to those rotated hexagonal structures, the related intensity is possibly too low at high scattering vector to be detected.

The matrix notation describing one of those rotated structures is Pt(111)-p$\begin{pmatrix} 1.20 & 0.00\\ 0.00 & 1.20 \end{pmatrix}$-R\ang{\pm 8.8}.
The closest rotated superstructure is Pt(111)-p(6x6)-R\ang{\pm 8.8}.
This means that in real space, the node closest to the origin where the Pt(111) and Pt(111)-p$\begin{pmatrix} 1.20 & 0.00\\ 0.00 & 1.20 \end{pmatrix}$-R\ang{\pm 8.8} lattices meet is at (6$a_{Pt_{111}}$, 6$b_{Pt_{111}}$), after rotation by \ang{\pm 8.8}.
This notation does not describe a surface reconstruction in this case, a sketch describing the real space unit cell can be found in app. \ref{fig:Pt11180O2Structures}.

Interestingly, summing the two vectors going from the centre of the reciprocal space to the white and purple circled peaks yields the position of the black circled peak in fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt111A} (c).
The angle between both vectors is then equal to \ang{42.6}, equivalent to \ang{137.4} in real space.
No other peak linked to this unit cell can be identified in this in-plane map.

% This unit cell can be described as follows: Pt(111)-p$\begin{pmatrix} 1.08 & -0.21 \\ -0.21 & 1.08 \end{pmatrix}$-R\ang{0}, and is not commensurate.
% Note that the rotation is zero even though the peaks are not in the same direction as the Pt(111) surface unit cell.
% The new structure vectors are described by a linear combination of the Pt(111) surface unit cell vectors.
% A sketch describing the real space unit cell can be found in app. \ref{fig:Pt11180O2Structures}.

The measurement of the entire reciprocal space in-plane map took about \qty{3}{\hour}\qty{35}{\minute}, the entire map being a concatenation of multiple $\mu$ scans during which the plane of the sample is rotated around its normal, the first scan starting near the centre of the reciprocal space.
The contribution of each scan during the measurement is visible from their different background.
There is approximately \qty{1}{\hour} between the measurement of the peaks circled in red, grey, purple and white, and the peak circled in black.

A second map was measured in a smaller region of the reciprocal space \qty{9}{\hour}\qty{30}{\minute} after the introduction of oxygen in the cell, to see if the intensity and position of the newly found peaks changed (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt111A} - d).
The measurement of this map took about \qty{1}{\hour}\qty{15}{\minute}.
Three additional peaks (circled in black in fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt111A} - d) appeared describing an epitaxied hexagonal lattice of parameter equal to $|\vec{a_{hex}}| = \qty{3.10}{\angstrom}$ (drawn in black dashed lines in fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt111A} - d).
This relation can also be described as follows : Pt(111)-p$\begin{pmatrix} 1.116 & 0 \\ 0 & 1.116 \end{pmatrix}$-R\ang{0}.
The average position of the three peaks with respect to the reciprocal space lattice nodes was used to determine the matrix.
The closest commensurate superstructure is Pt(111)-p(26x26)-R\ang{0}, a sketch describing the real space unit cell can be found in app. \ref{fig:Pt111AlphaPtO2}.
% The unit cell of this structure is in the same direction as the Pt(111) surface unit cell.

The grey and purple circled peaks seem to have disappeared from the reciprocal map (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt111A}, c, d), but an additional peak circled in red is revealed at \ang{120} from the other peak circled in red, and at \ang{60} from the peak circled in purple, at the same distance from the centre (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt111A} - d).
From these measurements, a first hypothesis to explain the observed peaks position is given.
First, two rotated hexagonal structures Pt(111)-p(6x6)-R\ang{\pm 8.8} appear (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt111A} - c).
Secondly, a Pt(111)-p(26x26)-R\ang{0} structure is observed, its second order peaks already detected while measuring the large reciprocal space in-plane map (black peak in fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt111A} - c), while the first order peaks can only be identified in the second reciprocal space map (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt111A} - d).
It is possible that the disappearance of the grey and purple circled peaks is linked to some alignment problems, visible from the large low intensity region in fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt111A} (d).
Otherwise, those peaks may disappear after the growth of the Pt(111)-p(26x26)-R\ang{0} structure.
It is not clear however why the remaining peaks are at \ang{120} of each other, in contradiction with the hypothesis of different hexagonal structures on the Pt(111) surface.

Super-structure rods (SSRs) were collected on the peaks belonging to the Pt(111)-p(26x26)-R\ang{0} structure, [H, K] = [0.89, 0] (fig. \ref{fig:LScans80} - a), and to the rotated hexagonal structures, [H, K] = [0.15, 0.74] (fig. \ref{fig:LScans80} - b), to probe their out-of-plane structures.
A second SSR was performed at [H, K] = [1.78, 0] to probe the intensity of a potential second-order peak associated to the Pt(111)-p(26x26)-R\ang{0} structure (fig. \ref{fig:LScans80} - c), approximately \qty{10}{\hour} after the measurement at [H, K] = [0.89, 0].

Interestingly, the position of the two peaks in [H, K] (visible in fig. \ref{fig:LScans80}, a-c) leads to a new definition of the structure since the closest commensurate superstructure is now Pt(111)-p(8x8)-R\ang{0}, with a lattice parameter equal to \qty{3.12}{\angstrom}.
It is possible that the elapsed time under oxidising atmosphere has had an effect of the 2D structure, that has become more relaxed.
The background-subtracted scattered intensity was integrated as a function of $L$ using the \textit{fitaid} module of \textit{BINoculars} (fig. \ref{fig:LScans80}).

\begin{figure}[!htb]

The integrated intensity for [H, K] = [-0.15, -0.74] shows a small peak at $L\approx 0.2$ followed by a constant intensity, characteristic of flat monolayers (fig. \ref{fig:SimROD}, Robinson et al. \cite*{Robinson1991}).

Mainly four different bulk platinum oxides have been reported to exist in literature, $\alpha$-\ce{PtO_2}, $\beta$-\ce{PtO_2}, \ce{Pt_3O_4} and \ce{PtO}.
The corresponding experimental structures are described in tab. \ref{tab:PtOxides}, together with the expected equilibrium structure found by Seriani et al \parencite*{Seriani2006, Seriani2008} using first-principles atomistic thermodynamics calculations, and molecular dynamics simulations based on density functional theory.

The intensity distribution along $L$ for Pt(111)-p(8x8)-R\ang{0} (fig. \ref{fig:LScans80}) suggests the presence of a multi-layer structure, possibly not even reaching the full unit cell (see simulated oxides structure in fig. \ref{fig:SimROD} - a).
Seriani et al. \parencite*{Seriani2006} have determined that the most stable surface oxide on the Pt(111) surface is hexagonal $\alpha$-\ce{PtO_2}.
A high uncertainty regarding the lattice parameter in the $\vec{c}$ direction is reported in experimental and theoretically studies due to a poor crystallisation of the bulk oxide \parencite{Muller1968}, and to underestimation of weak interlayer Van der Waals forces in theoretical studies \parencite{Li2005}.

The formation of hexagonal on hexagonal surface $\alpha$-\ce{PtO_2} on Pt(111) is expected to induce a high amount of in-plane compressive strain in the oxide layer, from the large difference between the Pt-Pt distance on the (111) surface (\qty{2.77}{\angstrom}) and the in-plane lattice parameter of $\alpha$-\ce{PtO_2} (\qty{3.14}{\angstrom}).
A rotation of \ang{30} is expected to reduce the in-plane strain, resulting in a (2x2) arrangement, no such structure was observed in this experiment on Pt(111).
The presence of $\alpha$-\ce{PtO_2} on the Pt(111) surface was also shown to provide favourable special sites that could contribute to the catalytic activity \parencite{Li2005}.
The unit cell of $\alpha$-PtO$_2$ is presented in fig. \ref{fig:AlphaPtO2}.

Ellinger et al. \parencite*{Ellinger2008} reported the existence of surface $\alpha$-\ce{PtO_2} on Pt(111) using SXRD at \qty{500}{\milli\bar} of oxygen, and at a temperature between \qty{245}{\degreeCelsius} and \qty{635}{\degreeCelsius}.
The in-plane lattice parameter is equal to \qty{3.15}{\angstrom}, close to the reported bulk value of $\alpha$-PtO$_2$ (tab. \ref{tab:PtOxides}, \qty{3.14}{\angstrom}).
Similarly to the current experiment, a Pt(111)-p(8x8)-R\ang{0} superstructure is reported, linked to surface $\alpha$-\ce{PtO_2},  also previously reported by Ackermann \parencite*{Ackermann2007}.
Ellinger et al. \parencite*{Ellinger2008} proposed a model for surface $\alpha$-\ce{PtO_2} consisting of a full unit cell, with an out-of-plane lattice parameter reduced by \qty{15}{\percent} in comparison with the bulk structure (\qty{3.62}{\angstrom}).
They introduced a displacement of \qty{\approx33}{\percent} of the platinum atoms on the top layers with respect to those of the bottom layer, in the ($\vec{a}_{\alpha-\ce{PtO_2}}$ + $\vec{b}_{\alpha-\ce{PtO_2}}$) direction (fig. \ref{fig:AlphaPtO2}) .
% The question of the epitaxial relation between both structures remains, since the proposed structure does come with a large misfit strain (\qty{13.5}{\percent}) when in a hexagonal on hexagonal arrangement.
% As our ﬁt is not compatible with domain formation, we are forced to conclude that oxide formation is initiated at step edges.
A super-structure rod collected at [H, K] = [0, 0.88] present a peak at $L=0.65$ ($L$ computed using the distorted $\alpha$-\ce{PtO_2} unit cell).

The two SSRs performed in the current study were fitted using two Gaussian peaks sharing the same full width at half maximum (FWHM), and a constant background (fig. \ref{fig:LScans80Fit}).
The second peak near $L=1$ in the SSR at [H, K] = [0.89, 0] comes from a Pt powder signal, while the peak at $L=2.4$ is from alien signal.

    \label{fig:LScans80Fit}
\end{figure}

A peak at [0.89, 0, 0.65] is visible, but using the Pt(111) surface unit cell, with an out-of-plane lattice parameter of \qty{6.79}{\angstrom}.
This is incompatible with the results presented in Ellinger et al \parencite*{Ellinger2008} since they used the lattice parameter of the refined $\alpha$-\ce{PtO_2} structure, $|\vec{c}|=\qty{4.16}{\angstrom}$.
It seems that a different out-of-plane structure is present in the current work.

XPS studies have also reported $\alpha$-\ce{PtO_2} above \qty{6.66}{\milli\bar} of \ce{O_2} at \qty{450}{\degreeCelsius} \parencite{Miller2011, Miller2014}.
As mentioned by Fantauzzi et al \parencite*{Fantauzzi2017}, the extended exposure to oxygen necessary to grow the oxide structure makes its characterisation difficult, the structure possibly evolving with time.

Additional simulations are needed to fully understand the structures in this study using the proposed distorted $\alpha$-\ce{PtO_2} structure, but also different surface models including the \textit{spoked-wheel} superstructure identified \textit{via} scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) by Van Spronsen et al \parencite*{VanSpronsen2017} and Boden et al. \parencite*{Boden2022}.
This structure, identified above \qty{1}{\bar} of oxygen, and at approximately \qty{200}{\degreeCelsius}, also exhibits a (8x8) coincidence with the Pt(111) lattice.

\end{figure}

Reflectivity curves measured in a specular geometry and fitted using \textit{GenX} \parencite{Bjorck2007, Glavic2022} are presented in fig. \ref{fig:Reflecto80}.
%The roughness is adjusted by the means of the surface root mean square roughness $\sigma$ in \unit{\angstrom}, as defined by Bennet et al. \parencite*{Bennett1961}.
The specular X-ray reflectivity simulations are conducted using the Parratt algorithm \parencite{Parratt1954}.
The classical way of implementing roughness is based on a Gaussian distribution, introducing corrective factors to the electric field amplitudes at the interfaces in accordance with the Nevot-Croce model \parencite{Nevot1980}.
For the computation of material refractive indices, the Henke tables \parencite{Henke1993} are employed.

A simple model was used consisting of a semi-infinite slab of platinum, on top of which is present a homogeneous layer of platinum oxide.
The density of the layer ($\rho_{ox}$) was set free during the minimisation process, between zero and \qty{21.2e-3}{FU\per\cubic\angstrom} (formula unit per cubic Angström, computed from unit cell elements and volume), the value for $\alpha$-PtO$_2$.
The initial intensity is fixed to obtain the best match at low incident angles, the intensity drop after the critical angle is difficult to fit, but the period of the oscillations, as well as the intensity at high angles are in general well represented.
The oscillation magnitude can be linked to the density of the oxide layer on top of the Pt(111) surface.
The fitted values (\qty{7.e-3}{FU\per\cubic\angstrom} and \qty{6.5e-3}{FU\per\cubic\angstrom}) are an order of magnitude below the expected value for a homogeneous layer of $\alpha$-PtO$_2$.
The root mean square roughness of the oxide layer $\sigma_{ox}$ is always zero, whereas the roughness of the Pt(111) surface ($\sigma_{sub}$) is of the same order of magnitude for both measurements.

The position of the oscillations visible in fig. \ref{fig:Reflecto80} can be linked to the thickness of the oxide layer ($t_{ox}$).
The layer is \qty{14.42}{\angstrom} and \qty{14.24}{\angstrom} thick in the first and second reflectivity curves, stable between both measurements.
The lateral information is lost during reflectivity measurements, meaning that different structures covering the Pt(111) surface cannot be distinguished with a simple model.
% A model with two layers in the fitting routine did not improve the final results.

By combining the information obtained from in-plane, SSRs and reflectivity measurements, it is probable that the platinum surface is first covered by two types of domains corresponding to two rotated hexagonal structures.
Secondly, a Pt(111)-p(8x8)-R\ang{0} structure is identified on the surface.
The layer thickness retrieved with reflectivity can indicate that a thin film is present on the surface, but no corresponding structure was yet identified with SXRD, which rather supports the existence of hexagonal monolayers, with a multi-layer thick epitaxied structure.
Future work will help identify the out-of-plane catalyst structure.

\subsection{Near ambient pressure ammonia oxidation cycle}

Ammonia was subsequently introduced in the reactor cell to investigate the evolution of the platinum oxide structures, as well as the presence of additional surface structures or surface reconstructions during ammonia oxidation (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt111B}, a-b).
The presence of $\alpha$-PtO$_2$ on Pt(111) has been shown to not hinder the oxidation of \ce{CO} by Ackermann et al. \parencite*{Ackermann2007}, that would then occur \textit{via} a Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism \parencite{Mars1954}, inducing a progressive roughening of the platinum surface.

\end{figure}

During ammonia oxidation, none of the previously observed peaks could be discerned, while no additional peaks emerged.
When the oxygen pressure within the cell was reduced to \qty{5}{\milli\bar} (favouring alternate products) or eliminated at \qty{0}{\milli\bar}, there was no formation of surface reconstructions or surface structures.
This result shows that the reaction removes the oxide layer present of the surface until the structure disappears.

No transition between the reaction products is observed in the first hours following the introduction of ammonia in the reactor (fig. \ref{fig:RGA450Pt111_2}), the presence of the surface oxide at the beginning of the condition seemingly not influencing the product selectivity.
All reciprocal space in-plane maps following the introduction of ammonia to a final atmosphere of \qty{500}{\milli\bar} of Argon showed a bulk-terminated surface (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt111B} - a, b, c, d), proving that the oxidation cycle is reproducible, and that ammonia effectively removed the different surface oxides that grew under \qty{80}{\milli\bar} of oxygen.

\end{figure}

Reflectivity curves were also measured and fitted with \textit{GenX} under pure Argon atmosphere (before and after the oxidation cycle), under different reacting conditions, and with only ammonia and argon in the reactor, presented in fig. \ref{fig:ReflectoCycle}.
In accordance with the results of the in-plane reciprocal space maps in fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt111B}, no oxide layer was used in the surface model.
Interestingly, the roughness of the [111]-oriented platinum crystal increased to \qty{2.80}{\angstrom} following the introduction of ammonia (fig. \ref{fig:ReflectoCycle} - b), after having reached \qty{2.14}{\angstrom} when previously exposed to \qty{80}{\milli\bar} of oxygen (fig. \ref{fig:Reflecto80}).
Since the reflectivity curves are measured at the start of each condition, it is possible that this high roughness is linked to the removal of the surface oxides.
Lowering the amount of oxygen is globally linked to a decrease of roughness (fig. \ref{fig:ReflectoCycle} - b).
The largest decrease is observed when switching the \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} partial pressure ratio from 8 to 0.5, \textit{i.e.} during reacting conditions.
The low roughness and removal of SXRD signals during ammonia oxidation is in contradiction with a possible Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism involving surface oxides at the current conditions, consistent with the reported Langmuir-Hinshelwood literature mechanism (sec. \ref{sec:Mechanism}).

\subsection{Oxide growth under 5 mbar of oxygen}

At the end of the complete ammonia oxidation cycle, the sample was put under \qty{5}{\milli\bar} of oxygen to see if the surface structures detected under high oxygen pressure can exist under lower oxygen pressure.
The aim being also to de-correlate the effect of the simultaneous presence of ammonia and oxygen in the cell on the surface when the \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} ratio is equal to \num{0.5}.
The sample was cleaned with two sputtering and annealing cycles before the introduction of oxygen.
Large and small reciprocal space in-plane maps were measured to have the best compromise between a higher temporal resolution of the oxide growth, and the possibility to detect other peaks from corresponding surface unit cells.
The larger reciprocal space in-plane maps are shown in fig. \ref{fig:LargeMapsPt111LowOxygen}.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{/home/david/Documents/PhDScripts/SixS_2023_04_SXRD_Pt111/figures/large_map_q_edited_5mbar.pdf}
    \caption{

    \label{fig:LargeMapsPt111LowOxygen}
\end{figure}

In the first map that started directly after the stabilisation of the oxygen pressure at \qty{5}{\milli\bar} in the reactor cell, low intensity signals can be detected (fig. \ref{fig:LargeMapsPt111LowOxygen} - a).
The detected peaks correspond to those detected previously shortly after having a pressure of \qty{80}{\milli\bar} in the cell (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt111A} - c).
The same coloured circles are used to indicate peaks at similar positions, the related interplanar spacing is also recapitulated in app. \ref{tab:InterplanarSpacingsPt111Oxygen}.
Some peaks start to split in a similar pattern, exhibiting three distinct signals around a more diffuse region (clearly visible for the red circled peak in fig. \ref{fig:LargeMapsPt111LowOxygen} - d).
The grey circled peak becomes fully visible after \qty{4}{\hour} of measurement.

This splitting of the peaks can be interpreted as the signature of a Pt(111) surface covered by different domains exhibiting similar hexagonal structures.
These domains are rotated by \ang{\pm 8.8} with respect to the Pt(111) surface unit cell, with a higher magnitude of the in-plane lattice parameter, following the same Pt(111)-p(6x6)-\ang{\pm8.8} structures observed under an oxygen pressure of \qty{80}{\milli\bar} (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt111A} - c).
No second order peak corresponding to these structures was observed.

A peak can be observed at [H, K] = [0.89, 0.89] in the large reciprocal space in-plane map collected between \qty{41}{\minute} and \qty{4}{\hour}\qty{3}{\minute} after the start of the condition (circled in black in fig. \ref{fig:LargeMapsPt111LowOxygen} - b).
The peak position is the same as in the first large reciprocal space in-plane map measured under \qty{80}{\milli\bar} of oxygen (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt111A} - c, tab. \ref{tab:InterplanarSpacingsPt111Oxygen}).
The position of this signal also corresponds to the Pt(111)-p(8x8)-R\ang{0} superstructure on Pt(111).
However, no peaks at [0.89, 0, 0] and [0, 0.89, 0] can yet be detected, before (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt111A} - b), and after (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt111A} - c) measuring this signal.
Such peaks are only detected in the large maps after \qty{\approx 24}{\hour} of measurements, (described by the hexagonal lattice drawn with black dashed lines in fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt111A} - f).

As mentioned before, it is possible to draw a surface unit cell in fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt111A} (b) that includes the peak at [0.89, 0.89] together with the white and purple circled peaks, but with an in-plane angle $\gamma^*$ equal in this case to \ang{42.2}.
% This has been described with the Pt(111)-p$\begin{pmatrix} 1.08 & -0.21 \\ -0.21 & 1.08 \end{pmatrix}$-R\ang{0} matrix notation.

The area sampled during the measurement was extended in the last two maps to observe more signals around the ($\bar{1}10$) region (fig. \ref{fig:LargeMapsPt111LowOxygen} - e, f).
For each map, the purple and red circled peaks around the Pt(111)-p(8x8)-R\ang{0} peaks are separated by \ang{60}, likewise for the grey and white circled peaks.
In the last two map, four doublet of peaks are visible, all peaks are split in a similar pattern.

During this set of measurement, the grey circled peak did not disappear in contrast with the measurements carried out under \qty{80}{\milli\bar} of oxygen, which furthermore supports the existence of two rotated hexagonal structures.
One linked to the red and purple peaks, while the other one is linked to the grey and white peaks.
Overall, it seems that both structures appear after introducing oxygen and the cell, and coexist with the Pt(111)-p(8x8)-R\ang{0} structure.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

    \label{fig:SmallMapsPt111LowOxygen}
\end{figure}

Smaller maps taken with a shorter time interval are presented in fig. \ref{fig:SmallMapsPt111LowOxygen}, in which a Pt(111)-p(8x8)-R\ang{0} peak is detected after \qty{\approx 23}{\hour} of measurements (circled in black).
The same peak was already detected after \qty{13}{hour} under \qty{80}{\milli\bar} of oxygen (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt111A} - d), highlighting the importance of the oxygen pressure in the surface oxidation.

A more quantitative analysis of the different structures appearing during the exposition to oxygen was performed by integrating the scattered intensity around the Pt(111)-p(8x8)-R\ang{0} and two Pt(111)-p(6x6)-R\ang{\pm8.8} signals present in the (100) region (respectively circled in black, red and white in fig. \ref{fig:SmallMapsPt111LowOxygen}).
The average background was subtracted to each reciprocal space voxel before integration.
%, while the intensity of the crystal truncation rod ($\bar{1}$10) Bragg peak was used for normalisation to correct possible miss-alignement effects on the integrated intensity.
The starting time of each reciprocal space in-plane map is used as estimate for the time since the introduction of oxygen, the evolution of each peak is presented in fig. \ref{fig:HexBraggPeaks}.
The growth of the Pt(111)-p(8x8)-R\ang{0} peak at [H, K] = [0, 0.89] follows an exponential increase after \qty{23}{\hour} of exposition.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

    }
    \label{fig:HexBraggPeaks}
\end{figure}

The white Pt(111)-p(6x6)-R\ang{\pm8.8} peak is visible from the start of the exposition to oxygen (fig. \ref{fig:SmallMapsPt111LowOxygen} - a), whereas the red Pt(111)-p(6x6)-R\ang{\pm8.8} peak is only clearly visible after \qty{7}{\hour} (fig. \ref{fig:SmallMapsPt111LowOxygen} - c), with a lower intensity.
Both peaks intensity quickly increases in the first hours of oxygen exposure, and then reach a steady state between \qtylist{8;23}{\hour}, increasing again together with the appearance of the Pt(111)-p(8x8)-R\ang{0} signal.
The Pt(111)-p(6x6)-R\ang{\pm8.8} peak intensity then starts to decreases after \qty{\approx 25}{\hour}.

Several SSRs have been measured at the positions of the Pt(111)-p(6x6)-R\ang{\pm8.8} peaks, presented in app. \ref{fig:LScans05}.
The intensity is constant as a function of $L$, similarly to the SSRs presented in fig. \ref{fig:LScans80}, which shows that the rotated hexagonal structures are flat monolayers on the Pt(111) surface.
No SSR was measured at the position of the Pt(111)-p(8x8)-R\ang{0} peak.

Lowering the oxygen partial pressure in the reactor cell from \qtyrange{80}{5}{\milli\bar} has demonstrated that similar in-plane structures appear, but with a slower growth rate.
All peaks are absent in the simultaneous presence of oxygen and ammonia in the reactor.
Additional studies are needed to understand if whether or not the rotated hexagonal structures act only as precursors for the Pt(111)-p(8x8)-R\ang{0} superstructure, or if those peaks are still present after an extended exposure to oxygen.
This structure could correspond to the oxide stripe hypothesised to be a precursor for surface $\alpha$-\ce{PtO_2} oxide on Pt(111) by Hawkins et al. \parencite*{Hawkins2009}.

Finally, reflectivity curves were measured just before the introduction of oxygen (in blue), \qty{14}{\hour} (orange) and \qty{23}{\hour} (green) after the introduction of oxygen, shown in fig. \ref{fig:Reflecto5}.
The last reflectivity curve was measured just before the detection of the Pt(111)-(8x8)-R\ang{0} structure with SXRD (fig. \ref{fig:SmallMapsPt111LowOxygen} - f).
The curves were fitted with \textit{GenX}.
Following the information gathered by SXRD, a homogeneous layer on top of Pt(111) was introduced in the model for the orange and green measurements, to represent the rotated structures visible in fig. \ref{fig:SmallMapsPt111LowOxygen}.
The oxide layer was necessary for the green curve to achieve a good fit, but only slightly improved the result for the orange curve.
The layer thickness and density are difficult to estimate since no oscillations are visible, which shows that those measured under \qty{80}{\milli\bar} or oxygen in fig. \ref{fig:Reflecto80} are linked to the Pt(111)-(8x8)-R\ang{0} structure.
This also further confirms that the red and white peaks are linked to thin layers, as observed in the SSRs in app. \ref{fig:LScans05}.
A transition in terms of oxide roughness and density is observed between the orange and green curves.
Interestingly, the final density is equal to that retrieved under \qty{80}{\milli\bar} of oxygen (fig. \ref{fig:Reflecto80}), but without the same layer thickness, and roughness.
This effect is clearly visible in the reflectivity curve with a decrease of intensity starting at low $\delta$ angles.
The substrate roughness increases with the elapsed time since the introduction of oxygen, coherent with the creation of a surface oxide.

\subsection{Surface roughness and surface relaxation effects}

    }
    \label{fig:CTRPt111}
\end{figure}

The ($2\bar{1}L$), (10L) and (11L) crystal truncation rods have been measured \qty{6}{\hour} after the start of each condition, each measurement took \qty{2}{\hour}.
The CTRs background-subtracted intensity was integrated using the \textit{fitaid} module of \textit{BINoculars} (sec. \ref{sec:BINoculars}), as a function of $L$, and with the same integration width in H and K.

The CTRs intensities are presented in fig. \ref{fig:CTRPt111}, they display only the expected features for the Pt(111) surface.
At first sight, mostly the surface roughness seems to evolve when changing condition, visible from the variation of intensity minimum near $L=1.5$ (or $L=2.5$ for the (10L) CTR).
Only the ($2\bar{1}L$) CTR measured under \qty{500}{\milli\bar} of argon before the oxidation cycle is available.

    \label{fig:Pt111StructureSideAndTop}
\end{figure}

To investigate potential surface relaxation effects, the three CTRs were fitted together with \textit{ROD}.
%, increasing the number of data points (h, k, l) at each condition.
A simple model was used, consisting of three stacked layers of \{111\} platinum planes (fig. \ref{fig:Pt111StructureSideAndTop}).
These three layers, in which relaxation effects can be detected, constitute the \textit{surface} of the crystal, on top of the \textit{bulk}.
$A$ is the layer closest to the bulk, whereas $C$ is the outermost layer.

Each atomic layer is treated rigidly, allowing only vertical displacement, to see if surface relaxations effect can be detected at different atmospheres.
Four different models have been tested to fit the CTR intensity as a function of $L$.
In the first, second, and third models, the one ($C$), two ($C$ \& $B$), and three ($C$ \& $B$ \& $A$) topmost layers have their own out of plane displacement parameter.
In the fourth model, the two topmost layers ($C$ \& $B$) share the same out-of-plane atomic displacement.

During the fitting process, in-plane atomic displacements were excluded as one of the parameters to be adjusted.
The presence of too many parameters posed challenges in achieving a successful convergence of the fitting routine.
The roughness parameter $\beta$ was set free.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

    \caption{
        Fitting results for roughness parameter $\beta$ (a) and out-of-plane strain $\sigma_z$ (b) as a function of the experimental conditions.
    }
    \label{fig:CTRFit111}
\end{figure}

The best fit is with the first model, the $C$ layer was allowed to have an out-of-plane atomic displacement $\delta_{z, C}$ between \qty{-0.05}{\angstrom} and \qty{0.05}{\angstrom}.
The position of the Pt atoms on the $A$ and $B$ layers were fixed, following the positions of the Pt atoms in the bulk.

The strain with respect to the bulk was computed according to eq. \ref{eq:StrainDiffraction}, the reference was set to the Pt(111) surface unit cell, \textit{i.e.} $|\vec{c}_{(111)}| = \qty{6.79}{\angstrom}$.
The evolution of the surface roughness and out-of-plane strain is shown in fig. \ref{fig:CTRFit111}.

The Pt(111) surface roughness increases with the introduction of Argon in the cell at \qty{450}{\degreeCelsius} (fig. \ref{fig:CTRFit111} - a), probably due to the presence of impurities contained in the argon gas flow.
The introduction of oxygen in the cell further increases the surface roughness, as expected from the formation of the different surface oxides visible in the in-plane reciprocal space maps (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt111A}, CTR recorded between c and d).
Adding ammonia in the reactor cell, which was shown to remove the different surface oxides, has also the effect of decreasing the surface roughness.
The $\beta$ parameter increases slightly again when oxygen is removed (fig. \ref{fig:CTRFit111} - a).
This result is probably more linked to a low quality fitting result, the corresponding curve (brown in fig. \ref{fig:CTRPt111}) is similar with the curve recorded previously under reacting conditions (purple in fig. \ref{fig:CTRPt111}), and with the following curve recorded under inert atmosphere (pink in fig. \ref{fig:CTRPt111}).
Moreover, the reflectivity results (fig. \ref{fig:ReflectoCycle}) have shown a decreasing roughness at this condition.
It seems that the ammonia oxidation cycle has effectively \textit{smoothed} the surface, possible by removing the presence of impurities and/or surface oxides.
Finally, the re-introduction of \qty{5}{\milli\bar} of oxygen increases the surface roughness again (fig. \ref{fig:CTRFit111} - a), in accordance with the formation of surface oxides detected during in-plane reciprocal space maps (fig. \ref{fig:LargeMapsPt111LowOxygen}).

Overall, a very low amount of strain is detected on the surface, almost imperceptible when observing the CTR minimum position in fig. \ref{fig:CTRPt111}.
From the fitting results, the topmost layer is already under tensile strain at UHV, further increased by the presence of Argon and possible impurities from the opening of the gas valves.

The largest evolution in the strain values comes from the high oxygen atmosphere, which has the effect of decreasing the surface strain, with an out-of-plane lattice parameter almost equal to the bulk value.
The formation of surface oxides observed under this atmosphere does not seem to have a very important effect on the surface relaxation state (with respect to the bulk lattice parameter).
It is possible that the oxide is preventing the metallic surface from directly interacting with oxygen, therefore allowing it to assume a lattice parameter similar to the bulk.
The introduction of ammonia increases again the surface strain, higher ammonia to oxygen ratio coincides with higher tensile strain.

Therefore, reacting conditions and the sole presence of ammonia had the effect of removing the surface oxides, and decreasing the surface roughness.
It is possible that the tensile strain in the last layer under Argon after the oxidation cycle corresponds to the equilibrium state of a clean Pt(111) surface.

Finally, the re-introduction of \qty{5}{\milli\bar} of oxygen decreases slightly the tensile strain on the topmost layer, a weaker but similar effect to the presence of \qty{80}{\milli\bar} of oxygen.
To conclude, no changes from tensile to compressive strain are observed during the reaction with respect to the bulk parameters.
The presence of oxygen alone has the effect of lowering the surface strain, while the presence of ammonia has the opposite effect.
Different reacting conditions are related to the same direction of displacement but with a higher magnitude when lowering the partial pressure of oxygen.

\subsection{Surface species}

To link surface structure, surface moieties and reaction products, the Pt 4f, N 1s and O 1s XPS spectra were recorded at near ambient pressure at the B07 beamline (Diamond Light Source), at \qty{450}{\degreeCelsius}.
The same sequence of conditions in the ammonia oxidation cycle was repeated as for the SXRD experiment, with the same ratio between reagents.

To keep the total pressure in a range compatible with the setup, all the measurements were performed without carrier gas and with a reagent pressure one order of magnitude lower than the SXRD experiments.
The conditions have been resumed in tab. \ref{tab:ConditionsXPS}.
Thanks to the geometry of the B07 beamline, the mass spectrometer allows us to monitor the presence of the reactants and products close to the sample surface (fig. \ref{fig:SampleSXRD} - c).
The gas composition in the vicinity of the sample surface is reported in fig. \ref{fig:XPS111RGA}.

\end{figure}

% Describe rga
After setting an inert atmosphere in the chamber, the oxidation cycle starts by the introduction of \qty{8.8}{\milli\bar} of oxygen, as detected in the RGA.
\qty{1.1}{\milli\bar} of \ce{NH_3} is then introduced in the reactor so that the \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} partial pressure ratio becomes equal to \num{8}.
This favours the production of \ce{NO} as expected, accompanied by a high amount of water, small amounts of \ce{N_2} and \ce{N_2O} can also be detected.
Despite the high pressure of oxygen in the reactor, approximately half of the pressure of ammonia is still detected.
The complete oxidation of ammonia may be limited by the availability of active sites, the transportation of reagents towards the catalyst surface or the relatively low temperature compared to industrial conditions (\qty{>700}{\degreeCelsius}) which can for example impact the active sites turnover frequency.

Reducing the \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} ratio to \num{0.5} by lowering the oxygen pressure has the remarkable effect of shifting the reaction selectivity \textit{entirely} towards \ce{N_2}, water is still the main product (fig. \ref{fig:XPS111RGA}).
\ce{H_2} coming from the simultaneous dissociation of \ce{NH_3} can be measured, not observed under a higher pressure of oxygen, which means that this reaction is not favoured when oxygen is present in the reactor.
Oxygen is undetected by the mass spectrometer when the \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} ratio is equal to \num{0.5}.
All of the oxygen available near the catalyst surface participates in the production of \ce{N_2} and \ce{H_2O} \textit{via} the oxidation reaction.
Ammonia can be thus considered to be in excess, and partly decomposing towards \ce{N_2}.
% The surface sites are occupied mainly by nitrogen species that cannot find a nearby oxygen or OH to react with, eventually decomposing towards nitrogen.

The following condition is pure ammonia.
Only the dissociation of ammonia happens on the catalyst surface, put into evidence by the presence of hydrogen and absence of water.
The glitch in the partial pressure at \qty{28.5}{\hour} is due to a re-setting of the total pressure to \qty{1.1}{\milli\bar}.

\subsubsection{N 1s and O 1s levels}

N 1s and O 1s levels were measured to probe for the existence of specific surface species, allowing us to obtain more information about the reaction mechanism, and thus to link surface state and selectivity.
The evolution of the N 1s and O 1s XPS spectra for different atmospheres is presented in fig. \ref{fig:O1sN1sPt111}.
Binding energies are obtained by aligning the Fermi level to \qty{0}{\eV}, all the reported peaks and corresponding species are detailed in tab. \ref{tab:XPSPt111}.

% high ox
The oxidation cycle is started by introducing \qty{8.8}{\milli\bar} of oxygen in the reactor.
The presence of gas phase oxygen (\ce{O_{2,g}}) can be confirmed in the O 1s spectra by a characteristic peak doublet around \qty{538}{\eV}.
The positions are shifted by \qty{2.2}{\eV} in binding energy with respect to literature (\qty{539.3}{\eV}, \qty{540.4}{\eV}, Avval et al. \cite*{Avval2022}).
This is explained by a change in the work function of the sample-analyser setup, impacting gas species exclusively since not in electrical contact with the system \parencite{Starr2021}.
This signal is also present when the \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} ratio is equal to 8, but not when equal to 0.5, suggesting that all the oxygen is used in the surface vicinity, in accordance with the RGA signals (fig. \ref{fig:XPS111RGA}).
\ce{O_{2,g}} is also detected when only \qty{0.55}{\milli\bar} of oxygen is in the cell.

The broad signal extending from \qtyrange{528.5}{533}{\eV} is hiding various peaks, linked to the presence of oxygen species.
Fisher et al \parencite*{Fisher1980} report the signal for adsorbed oxygen (\ce{O_{a}}) and adsorbed hydroxyl groups (\ce{OH_{a}}) at respectively \qty{529.8}{\eV} and \qty{531}{\eV} when exposing the Pt(111) surface to water.
Peuckert et al. \parencite*{Peuckert1984} have studied various oxidised Pt surfaces and indexed a peak at \qty{530.2}{\eV} for \ce{O_{a}} on Pt(111), and at \qty{531.5}{\eV} for \ce{OH_{a}} on polycristalline Pt.
Derry et al. \parencite*{Derry1984} report \qty{530.8}{\eV} for \ce{O_{a}} on Pt(111) during its exposition to oxygen, while Zhu et al. \parencite*{Zhu2003} report \ce{O_{a}} at \qty{529.9}{\eV} when probing the dissociation of \ce{NO} on the Pt(111) surface.
Fantauzzi et al. \parencite*{Fantauzzi2017} report oxygen surface species at \qty{529.7}{\eV} during the oxidation of Pt(111) at \qty{225}{\degreeCelsius}, similarly to Miller et al. \parencite*{Miller2014}.

During a recent study of the oxidation of ammonia at different pressures and \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} ratio on Pt(111), (2x2) chemisorbed oxygen and hydroxyl groups were reported respectively at \qty{529.7}{\eV} and \qty{531.4}{\eV} in \qty{1}{\milli\bar} of oxygen at \qty{325}{\degreeCelsius} \parencite{Ivashenko2021}.

In the current XPS study, the signal to noise ratio does not allow to clearly discern and locate peaks between \qtylist{528.5;533}{\eV}.
It is probable however that hydroxyl groups as well as atomic oxygen are adsorbed on the surface around \qty{529.7}{\eV} and \qty{531.4}{\eV} respectively.
Such O 1s features can be seen when the oxygen pressure is equal to \qty{0.55}{\milli\bar}, but with a higher apparent amount of atomic oxygen species in comparison to hydroxyl groups.

From the previous SXRD measurements, it was seen that a Pt(111)-(8x8)-R\ang{0} superstructure grows under the presence of \qty{5}{\milli\bar} of oxygen, but only after at least \qty{22}{\hour}.
Similar structures have been linked to a surface $\alpha$-\ce{PtO_2} oxide \parencite{Ackermann2007, Ellinger2008}.
Two Pt(111)-(6x6)-R\ang{\pm8.8} structures, possibly precursors of the Pt(111)-(8x8)-R\ang{0} structure, have been measured in the minutes following the introduction of oxygen.
Therefore, if the Pt(111)-(8x8)-R\ang{0} structure is not expected here since the duration of each condition is below \qty{5}{\hour}, the precursor structure may yield some signals between \qtylist{528.5;533}{\eV} in the O 1s level.
For example, a large peak at \qty{530.7}{\eV} attributed to Pt surface oxides has been observed at an oxygen pressure of \qty{1}{\bar} by Van Spronsen et al. \parencite{VanSpronsen2017}.

% ratio 8
For the \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} = 8 condition, only a weak signal at \qty{402.6}{\eV} can be detected in the N 1s spectrum.
At those reaction condition, and with \qty{40}{\min} acquisition time, most of the signals can still be below detection limits.
Gas phase nitric oxide (\ce{NO_{g}}), ammonia (\ce{NH_{3,g}}), nitrogen (\ce{N_{2,g}}), and nitrous oxide (\ce{NO_{2,g}}) are visible in the RGA signals (fig. \ref{fig:XPS111RGA}).

The main product, \ce{NO_{g}}, is expected between \qty{404.5}{\eV} and \qty{406.7}{\eV} in the N 1s level, observed during reacting conditions with an equal amount of oxygen and ammonia, a total pressure of \qty{1}{\milli\bar}, and temperature of \qty{325}{\degreeCelsius} \parencite{Ivashenko2021}.
Since not observed in the O 1s level, the authors have proposed that the related signal is hidden by the important gas phase oxygen features.
The same study reports \ce{N_{2,g}} between \qty{403.9}{\eV} and \qty{404.8}{\eV}, and \ce{NH_{3,g}} at \qty{400.4}{\eV}.
\ce{NH_{3,g}} was also measured shifted to \qty{400.7}{\eV} under \qty{1}{\milli\bar} of ammonia, without oxygen present in the cell.

Adsorbed nitrogen oxide (\ce{NO_a}) is absent, expected to yield peaks between \qty{530}{\eV} and \qty{532}{\eV} in the O 1s level, and between \qty{400.4}{\eV} and \qty{401.3}{\eV} in the N 1s level \parencite{Kiskinova1984, Zhu2003, Gunther2008}.
It is worth noticing that this region is also populated by water and \ce{OH_a} signals.
Since \ce{NO} is one of the main products at this condition, the absence of \ce{NO_a} can be explained by short desorbing time from the Pt(111) surface after formation \parencite{Ivashenko2021}.

The peak at \qty{402.6}{\eV} in this study could not be safely indexed, since situated far away in binding energy from any of the reported gas phase peaks, and of adsorbed nitrogen and \ce{NH_x} type features.
Gas phase water (\ce{H_2O_{g}}) is visible in the O 1s spectra by a peak at \qty{534}{\eV}, as reported during ammonia oxidation by Weststrate et al. \parencite*{Weststrate2006}, probably generated by the oxidation reaction.
The energy difference between the low energy peak of \ce{O_{2,g}} and \ce{H_2O_{g}}, \qty{3.5}{\eV}, is close to the difference reported in literature for pure gas phases, equal to \qty{3.3}{\eV} \parencite{Linford2019, Avval2022}.
%It is possible that the \ce{O_{2, g}} features are hiding the signal of gas phase \ce{NO} in the O 1s level, expected to be near \qty{538}{\eV}. % ignored bc not seen in ref

% ratio 0.5
By lowering the oxygen pressure to \qty{0.55}{\milli\bar} so that \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} = 0.5, nitrogen production is favoured (fig. \ref{fig:XPS111RGA}), three peaks can be detected in the N 1s level.
\qty{397.5}{\eV} is characteristic of adsorbed atomic nitrogen (\ce{N_{a}}) on Pt(111) \parencite{vandenBroek1999, Zhu2003}.
The energy difference between \ce{N_{a}}, \ce{NH_{a}}, and \ce{NH_{2,a}} is reported to be approximately \qty{0.95}{\eV}, \qty{1.9}{\eV} in total on Pt(111) \parencite{Ivashenko2021}, which is too few to link the peak at \qty{399.8}{\eV} to \ce{NH_{a}} or \ce{NH_{2,a}} with respect to the \ce{N_{a}} peak.
Since there is a peak at \qty{400.8}{\eV} in the following spectrum that can be linked to gas phase ammonia from similar reported binding energies, the peak at \qty{399.8}{\eV} is attributed to adsorbed ammonia (\ce{NH_{3,a}}).
% A contribution from \ce{NH_{3, g}} is also possible since
% Moreover, \ce{NH_{3,a}} is reported at \qty{400.0}{\eV} on Pt(410) by Günther et al. \parencite*{Gunther2008}.
The peak at \qty{404.1}{\eV} is attributed to \ce{N_{2,g}}, which is the only measured nitrogen product, and also in accordance with reported binding energies.

No oxygen is anymore detected in the reactor, as observed with the mass spectrometer (fig. \ref{fig:XPS111RGA}).
Moreover, no \ce{OH_{a}} and \ce{O_{a}} peaks can be detected in the O 1s level (fig. \ref{fig:O1sN1sPt111}), even though the total pressure was divided by \num{6}, increasing the detection of photo-electrons.
Adsorbed water groups (\ce{H_2O_{a}}) are reported between \qty{532.2} and \qty{532.9} eV on Pt(111) depending on the surface coverage \parencite{Fisher1980, Kiskinova1985}, to which is attributed the peak at \qty{532}{\eV}.

The presence of adsorbed water supports a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism with quick stripping of hydrogen from \ce{NH_{x,a}} species by \ce{OH_a} and \ce{O_a}, eventually forming adsorbed water.
The de-hydrogenation process must be limiting the catalytic activity due to the lack of available adsorbed oxygen species near adsorbed ammonia, which could be why \ce{NH_{3,a}} is observed, but not \ce{NH_{x,a}}.
The key importance of available atomic oxygen for the production of \ce{NO} is supported by the simultaneous absence of \ce{O_a} in the O 1s level, and the absence of \ce{NO} in the RGA signals (fig. \ref{fig:XPS111RGA}).
The presence of adsorbed nitrogen could be due to long residual times on the catalyst before recombination and desorption of \ce{N_2}.
This hypothesis is in accordance with the commonly accepted reaction mechanism detailed in sec. \ref{sec:Mechanism}.

% ammonia
Once oxygen is removed, gas phase water disappears from the O 1s level, suggesting that water in gas phase is mostly present from the oxidation reaction rather than as UHV/gas contaminant.
Adsorbed water is still visible, possibly from long desorption time before producing water, or from contaminants.
The energy level differs by \qty{0.5}{\eV} from adsorbed water during reacting conditions, signifying different chemical environments.
As observed in the mass spectrometer, the dissociation of ammonia towards nitrogen still occurs, a slightly shifted \ce{N_{2,g}} peak is reported at \qty{405.3}{\eV}.
There is a clear effect of the presence of oxygen on the position of gas phase signals.
The large peak linked to atomic nitrogen has disappeared, a peak linked to \ce{NH_{3,g}} is reported as well as a large and weak peak probably linked to \ce{NH_x} groups.
The dissociation of ammonia is reported to be slower without the help of oxygen species on Pt(111) \parencite{Offermans2006,Offermans2007, Imbihl2007, NovellLeruth2008}.
This could explain why such a large peak is observed for \ce{NH_{x,a}}, and why \ce{NH_{3,g}} is observed rather than \ce{NH_{3,a}}, since most of the adsorption sites are probably occupied by \ce{NH_{x,a}} species.
The difficulty to fully dissociate ammonia is also correlated to the production of hydrogen, it is possible that the combination of two hydrogen atoms removed from ammonia to produce \ce{H_2} is slow, and thus occupies part of the adsorption sites.

% argon
The introduction of argon and removal of ammonia increases the \ce{H_2O_{g}} signal, possibly from contaminants.
Some nitrogen rich species are still visible.
Just like water, ammonia has the tendency to adsorb well on the inner walls of the chamber resulting in a slow pumping speed.
Removing argon and introducing \qty{0.55}{\milli\bar} of oxygen has removed all the N 1s peaks by the oxidation of the leftover \ce{NH_x} species.
As previously discussed, comparable peaks are observed in the O 1s level as under \qty{8.8}{\milli\bar} of oxygen, linked to hydroxyl groups, \ce{O_a}, and \ce{O_{2,g}}.

\end{figure}

The Pt 4f level was also measured to report possible differences in the chemical environment of surface platinum atoms (fig.\ref{fig:Pt4fPt111}).
Miller et al. \parencite*{Miller2011} have measured two peaks at \qtylist{72.1;73.5}{\eV} under \qty{6.66}{\milli\bar} of oxygen at \qty{450}{\degreeCelsius}.
The \qty{72.1}{\eV} peak is assigned to (i) oxygen between the metallic surface and surface $\alpha$-\ce{PtO_2} oxide as reported by Ellinger et al. \parencite*{Ellinger2008}.
The \qty{73.5}{\eV} peak is attributed to (ii) Pt atoms within the trilayer oxide structure.

However, both peaks are absent at \qty{0.66}{\milli\bar} of oxygen at \qty{350}{\degreeCelsius}, for which the presence of (iii) p(2x2) chemisorbed oxygen and (iv) "4O" oxide surface stripes are linked to two other peaks, respectively \qty{71.1}{\eV}, and \num{71.6}-\qty{71.7}{\eV}.

In a following study under \qty{13.33}{\milli\bar} of oxygen, slightly shifted high intensity peaks at \qty{72.2}{\eV} and \qty{73.6}{\eV} are linked to the presence of surface $\alpha$-\ce{PtO_2} oxide, fully covering a Pt(111) crystal \parencite{Miller2014}.
The photon energy for both experiments is equal to \qty{275}{\eV}, whereas the photon energy is here equal to \qty{550}{\eV}.
Thus, both studies by the Miller group are more sensitive to the surface structure since the emitted photo-electrons have increased inelastic mean free paths.
Interestingly the crystal preparation to grow surface $\alpha$-\ce{PtO_2} oxide is not too far from this study.
The Pt(111) crystal was exposed to \qty{13.33}{\milli\bar} of oxygen for \qty{10}{\minute} while cycling the temperature from \qtyrange{25}{525}{\degreeCelsius} four times.

A small peak can be identified near \qty{71.6}{\eV} in the current experiment under \qty{8.88}{\milli\bar} of oxygen that could correspond to the oxide stripe structure.
Its presence is not certain since the intensity is very low, corresponding potential peaks in the O 1s level cannot be resolved either.
No clear peak could be detected near \qty{73.5}{\eV} in the Pt 4f$_{7/2}$ level, but a very small peak can be seen at \qty{72.1}{\eV}.
Since the presence of surface $\alpha$-\ce{PtO_2} oxide was linked to very high intensity peaks by Miller et al. \parencite*{Miller2014}, this structure can safely be ruled out in this study.
It seems that the temperature cycling is crucial to grow $\alpha$-\ce{PtO_2} on Pt(111).
The peak maxima is shifted by \qty{0.09}{\eV} when introducing \qty{8.88}{\milli\bar} of oxygen in the cell after pure argon atmosphere.
Overall, the lack of clear peak corresponding to the "4O" oxide stripe and $\alpha$-\ce{PtO_2} phases suggests that the oxygen on the Pt(111) surface is mostly chemisorbed, which could also be why the peak is slightly shifted towards \qty{71.1}{\eV}.

When introducing \qty{1}{\milli\bar} of ammonia in the reactor, the maximum of the Pt 4f$_{7/2}$ peak is measured back at the position under inert atmosphere, while a new component is measured at \qty{70.5}{\eV}.
Reducing the pressure of oxygen to \qty{0.55}{\milli\bar} further increases the intensity of the latter component compared to the maximum peak intensity.
Removing oxygen but keeping ammonia in the reactor removes this peak.
Since the intensity of this peak increases when the \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} ratio decreases, \textit{i.e.} when all the oxygen is consumed, it is probably linked to the presence of adsorbed nitrogen species on the platinum surface.
The absence of this peak under the presence of ammonia in the cell, for which adsorbed nitrogen can not be detected, supports a link with \ce{N_a} or \ce{NH_{3, a}} (fig. \ref{fig:O1sN1sPt111}).

Only a smaller shift is repeated when \qty{0.55}{\milli\bar} of oxygen is introduced after \qty{1}{\milli\bar} or argon, approximately equal to \qty{0.2}{\eV}.
Both spectra collected under argon before and after the oxidation cycle are very similar, some nitrogen species possibly left on the surface are probably removed by oxygen, which explains the increased intensity after the oxidation cycle near \qty{70.5}{\eV}.

% Parkinson et al. \parencite*{Parkinson2003} measured a peak at \qty{76.8}{\eV} after oxygen adsorption at room temperature, which disappeared after annealing at \qty{500}{\degreeCelsius}.
% This peak was linked to a peak between \qty{530.2}{\eV} and \qty{530.8}{\eV} in the O 1s level, and asigned to a sub-surface oxide.
% Weaver et al. \parencite*{Weaver2005} have reported at peak at \qty{76.9}{\eV} at \qty{175}{\degreeCelsius} after deposition of oxygen on the surface.
