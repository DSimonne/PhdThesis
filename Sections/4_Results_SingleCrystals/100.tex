\section{Pt(100) single crystal studied at \qty{450}{\degreeCelsius}} \label{sec:SXRD100}

% check values for in plane lattice parameter from orientation matrix

% keep the same notation for [H, K]

A similar experiment was carried out on a different surface of platinum, namely the Pt(100) surface.
The arrangement of the Pt atoms on the (100) surface is square, the distance between in-plane neighbouring Pt atoms is smaller than between out-of-plane atoms.
A surface unit cell must be derived, shown in fig. \ref{fig:SurfaceUnitCellPt100}, to be able to better represent the surface arrangement of the Pt atoms.
The in-plane vectors $\vec{a}_{(100)}$ and $\vec{b}_{(100)}$ are of equal magnitude ($a_{Pt} / \sqrt{2} = \qty{2.775}{\angstrom})$, separated by \ang{90}.
The out-of-plane vector $\vec{c}_{(100)}$ is perpendicular to the (100) plane, and of magnitude $a_{Pt} = \qty{3.9242}{\angstrom}$.

\subsection{Oxide growth under \qty{80}{\milli\bar} of oxygen}

Reciprocal space in-plane maps were collected using the same experimental setup and at the same atmospheres detailed in tab. \ref{tab:ConditionsSXRD}, to probe the structural evolution of the sample during the oxidation of ammonia.
The total pressure is always kept to \qty{500}{\milli\bar}.
Considering the square symmetry in the position of the Bragg peaks, the in-plane reciprocal space maps were collected by rotating the in-plane sample and detector angles ($\omega$ and $\gamma$) from \ang{0} to \ang{90} to collect a quarter of the reciprocal space in the ($\vec{q}_x$, $\vec{q}_y$) plane

The reciprocal space in-plane map were computed in both $q$-space (to obtain the interplanar spacing related to the observed signals) and ($hkl$)-space to visualise the arrangement of surface structures or surface relaxations in comparison with the structure of the Pt atoms on the (100) surface, the $h$ and $k$ values being computed using the square surface unit cell of the Pt(100) surface.

    \caption{
        Reciprocal space in-plane maps collected under different atmospheres measured at \qty{450}{\degreeCelsius}, computed using the surface lattice of Pt(100).
    }
    \label{fig:MapsPt100A}
\end{figure}

The first map was collected under \qty{500}{\milli\bar} of Ar, after the cleaning of the sample by sputtering and annealing (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt100A} - a).
The (200), (1$\bar{1}$0) and (0$\bar{2}$0) Bragg peaks can be observed, together with the extremity of [100]-oriented crystal truncation rods going through the [0, 1, 0] and [0, $\bar{1}$, 0] positions in reciprocal space.

Two different types of peaks can be observed under \qty{80}{\milli\bar} of oxygen, identified by red and green circles in fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt100A} (b).
The red peaks are situated at intermediate positions in reciprocal space in comparison with the Pt(100) lattice [H, K] = [1, -0.5], [H, K] = [1, -1.5], [H, K] = [0.5, $\bar{1}$] and [H, K] = [0.5, -1.5].
The green peaks are slightly shifted from the red peaks by the same amount $\delta = 0.07$ in either H or K.

Four consecutive out-of-plane measurements were performed perpendicular to four peaks, two of each type, up to $L=3.5$ to probe the related out-of-plane structure.
The background-subtracted intensity was integrated as a function of $L$ using the \textit{fitaid} module of \textit{binoculars} (fig. \ref{fig:LScansHighOxygenPt100}).

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{/home/david/Documents/PhDScripts/SixS_2022_01_SXRD_Pt100/figures/l_scans_high_oxygen_no_map.pdf}
    \caption{
        Out-of plane measurements for four different positions under \qty{80}{\milli\bar} of \ce{O_2}, and \qty{420}{\milli\bar} of \ce{Ar}.
    }
    \label{fig:LScansHighOxygenPt100}
\end{figure}

The intensity as a function of $L$ for the shifted peaks was found to quickly decrease down to zero, which shows that they do not correspond to 3D structures but are more characteristic of monolayers with no out-of-plane periodicity (fig. \ref{fig:SimROD}, Robinson et al. \cite*{Robinson1991}).
No corresponding surface unit cell could be derived from their in-plane positions.

However, four peaks at different $L$ values are visible on both $L$-scans perpendicular to the red circled peak, including at $L=0$, which is characteristic of a bulk structure, \textit{i.e.} more than a few unit cells thick \parencite{Robinson1991}.
The peaks were fitted using a model with four Gaussian peaks and a constant background, the same full width at half maxima was used for all four peaks (fig. \ref{fig:FitPt100LScans}).

Corresponding interplanar spacings were computed from the position of the peaks, which were found to coincide with a slightly distorted cubic unit cell of in-plane lattice parameter equal to \qty{5.60}{\angstrom} and out-of-plane lattice parameter equal to \qty{5.64}{\angstrom}, used to index each Bragg peak in the figure.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

    }
    \label{fig:FitPt100LScans}
\end{figure}

Bulk \ce{Pt_3O_4} was reported to crystallise in a cubic structure (space group $P_{m3n}$) with a lattice parameter equal to \qty{5.65}{\angstrom} \parencite{Galloni1941, Galloni1952, Muller1968}, more recent studies have proposed a theoretical value of \qty{5.59}{\angstrom} \parencite{Seriani2006}, already presented in tab. \ref{tab:PtOxides}, similarly to the parameters reported in this study.
The 3D structure of bulk \ce{Pt_3O_4} is presented in fig. \ref{fig:Pt3O4}, the (212) and (232) reflections are not allowed.

\begin{SCfigure}
    \centering

        Platinum atoms are situated on the faces on the cubic unit cell (e.g. $(0, 1/2, 1/4)$, $(0, 1/2, 3/4)$), while the eight oxygen atoms are inside the unit cell at the positions $(1/4, 1/4, z)$, $(1/4, 2/4, z)$, $(2/4, 1/4, z)$, $(2/4, 2/4, z)$ for $z=1/4$ and $z=3/4$.
    }
    \label{fig:Pt3O4}
\end{SCfigure}

The epitaxial relationship between both is \ce{Pt_3O_4}[001]||Pt[001], the in-plane lattice parameter of \ce{Pt_3O_4} being approximately twice that of the Pt(100) surface lattice parameter, which allows the formation of a cubic on cubic coherent interface.
%In the current experiment, the misfit strain computed with eq. \ref{eq:StrainDiffraction} is equal to \qty{1.7}{\percent}, which can be the reason for the distorted structure.

A first guess of the height of the oxide layer can be obtained by measuring the FWHM $\sigma$ of each peak in the $\vec{z}$ direction and thereby computing the layer thickness using the equation $2\pi/\sigma$ \parencite{Warren1990}.
A thickness of \qty{62.65}{\angstrom} and \qty{60.18}{\angstrom} is found for the first and second measurement.
For bulk \ce{Pt_3O_4} this would correspond to approximately 11 unit cells.

\subsection{Near ambient pressure ammonia oxidation cycle}

\end{figure}

Introducing ammonia in the reactor has resulted in the loss of contact with the sample heater, from the corrosion of the screws responsible for the contact on the sample holder.
Nevertheless, half of the large reciprocal space in-plane maps could be measured prior to the loss of alignment (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt100B} - a), in which the red circled peaks corresponding to \ce{Pt_3O_4} are still visible, the two other peaks at (0.93, -0.5) and (0.5, -0.93) have disappeared.

The sample was removed and cleaned to fix the sample heater, and then introduced in the reactor.
In order to probe for the reproducibility of the \ce{Pt_3O_4} growth on the surface, the partial pressure of oxygen was set to \qty{80}{\milli\bar} again, while measuring a small area of the in-plane reciprocal space to detect the same peaks as in fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt100A} (b).
The same peaks could indeed be detected as shown in fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt100B} (b), but with a shift between the green and red circled peaks equal to $0.09$, more important than the previously measured value of $0.07$.

Ammonia was again introduced in the cell to be able to probe the relation between surface structure and selectivity during the oxidation of ammonia.
Interestingly, a different behaviour was measured during the following reciprocal space in-plane map (fig. \ref{fig:MapsAndLScansPt100HighOxAmmonia}).

    }
    \label{fig:MapsAndLScansPt100HighOxAmmonia}
\end{figure}

Peaks separated by $0.1$ in H or in K were observed around the platinum Bragg peaks in a square arrangement, similarly to a (10x10) surface reconstruction, but with some extinctions.
Most of the peaks are observed at $H={0,1,2}$ or $K={0, -1}$ (fig. \ref{fig:MapsAndLScansPt100HighOxAmmonia}).
The other peaks are observed in rown or columns shifted with respect to the (1, $\bar{1}$, 0) Bragg peak by $0.09$, following the shift of the green circled peaks observed while only oxygen is present in the cell (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt100B} - b).

Out-of-plane measurements were performed perpendicular to four peaks, also presented in fig. \ref{fig:MapsAndLScansPt100HighOxAmmonia}.
The peaks measured earlier perpendicular to [H, K] = [0.5, $\bar{1}$] at $L=0.7$, $L=1.4$, and $L=2.1$ corresponding to bulk \ce{Pt_3O_4} are no longer visible.

It is not certain that bulk \ce{Pt_3O_4} was present on the catalyst surface at the beginning of the reacting conditions.
Indeed, the sample was exposed to \qty{80}{\milli\bar} of oxygen for \qty{12}{\hour} when the bulk oxide could be measured.
The second exposition only lasted for \qty{1}{\hour}, during which the same in-plane could effectively be measured, but without out-of-plane information.
Therefore it is not clear whether the lack of bulk oxide is due to its removal from the reacting conditions or from the shorter exposition to a high oxygen atmosphere.
However, it is clear that the duration of the high oxygen condition, probably linked to the thickness of the \ce{Pt_3O_4} layer, has an effect on the catalyst surface during reaction condition since the in-plane signals measured after the introduction of ammonia are very different.
Regarding the $L$-scan at [H, K] = [1.9, 0], the two peaks near $L=0.1$ and $L=2.1$ are coming from the nearby Bragg peaks.
Otherwise, no structures signal in $L$ can be observed.

\ce{Pt_3O_4} has been proven to be a source of oxygen atoms sustaining the catalytic oxygenation of \ce{CO} \textit{via} a Mars Van Krevelen mechanism \parencite{Seriani2006, Seriani2008}.
In the current experiment, the heater problem prevented us from recording the evolution of the reaction products during the first exposition of the catalyst to the reacting conditions.
Additional measurements with first different exposition times to a pure oxygen atmosphere (while monitoring the thickness of the \ce{Pt_3O_4} layer), and secondly introducing ammonia in the reactor while comparing the product partial pressure could bring an answer to the role of \ce{Pt_3O_4} during the oxidation of ammonia.
It is possible that the (10x10)-type reconstructions observed in the current experiment are linked to the adsorption of nitrogen species on the catalyst surface.

Lowering the partial pressure of oxygen from \qty{80}{\milli\bar} to \qty{5}{\milli\bar} in the reactor has completely removed the square (10x10) reconstruction phenomena and revealed the existence of two hexagonal arrangements on top on the Pt(100) surface (fig. \ref{fig:MapsAndLScansPt100LowOxAmmonia}), with an in-plane lattice parameter equal to \qty{2.685}{\angstrom}, \qty{\approx 3.36}{\percent} lower than the distance between neighbouring Pt atoms on the Pt(100) surface.
Second order peaks can also be seen at the edge of the reciprocal space in-plane map, each domain has one axis parallel to either $\vec{a}_{(100)}$ or $\vec{b}_{(100)}$, \textit{i.e.} respectively in the [110] and [1$\bar{1}$0] directions.

% precursor to bulk is chemisorbed \parencite{BradleyShumbera2007}

Different hexagonal surface reconstructions on the Pt(100) surface have been reported also in the [110] direction at UHV conditions, summarised in \cite{Hammer2016}, based on an important body of work \parencite{Heilmann1979, Vanhove1981, Heinz1982, Mase1992, Kuhnke1992, Borg1994, VanBeurden2004, Havu2010}, evolving to rotated hexagonal reconstructions with angles between \ang{0.77} and \ang{0.94} depending on the sample temperature and on the previous temperature treatment.
The unit cell describing those reconstructions with respect to the Pt(100) surface varies, if first contained to (5XN) where N = 20–30, the latest study reports a commensurate c(26x118) superstructure.
Exposition of the rotated hexagonal structure to oxygen at \qty{450}{\degreeCelsius} studied by low energy electron diffraction (LEED) has been found to remove the hexagonal structure and precipitate the growth of surface oxides \textit{via} different phases \parencite{BradleyShumbera2007, BradleyShumbera2007a}, a similar conclusion was reached by \cite{Deskins2005} by DFT studies.
Exposition to \ce{NO} has been reported to stabilise the clean Pt(100) phase \parencite{Heinz1982}, while exposition to \ce{CO} removes the hexagonal reconstruction, an oscillatory behaviour between a clean (1X1) surface and the rotated hexagonal reconstruction was reported by Cox et al. \parencite*{Cox1983}.

A (2X2) reconstruction of the Pt(100) surface has been reported at an oxygen pressure of \qty{1e-3}{mbar} by the use of environmental TEM \parencite{Li2016}.

Subsurface oxygen has also been predicted to exist on Pt(100) \parencite{Gu2007}, reported at a pressure of \qty{0.133}{\milli\bar} \parencite{McMillan2005}, and participating in the catalytic oxidation of \ce{CO}.
Subsurface oxygen was identified as a precursor to a stable surface oxide during the catalytic oxidation of \ce{CO} by Dicke et al. \parencite*{Dicke2000}, at an oxygen pressure of \qty{0.09}{\milli\bar}, its appearance linked to the lifting of surface reconstructions on the clean Pt(100) surface from the adsorption of \ce{CO}, which then allowed oxygen atoms to penetrate under the topmost layer of platinum \parencite{Rotermund1993, Lauterbach1994}.

Overall, few works at ambient pressure have been found to exist, even less during the catalytic oxidation of ammonia.
Out-of-plane measurements were performed perpendicular to two peaks, also shown in fig. \ref{fig:MapsAndLScansPt100LowOxAmmonia}, no bulk structure could be detected.

\end{figure}

After removing oxygen from the reactor, only the first order reflections corresponding to the hexagonal structures could be detected during the measurement of the reciprocal space in-plane map (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt100C}), the following measurement under Argon showed a clean Pt(100) surface.

\subsection{Oxide growth under \qty{5}{\milli\bar} of oxygen}

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.495\textwidth]{/home/david/Documents/PhDScripts/SixS_2022_01_SXRD_Pt100/figures/Map_hkl_surf_or_2905-2953_patched.pdf}

    \label{fig:MapsPt100D}
\end{figure}

To make sure that the hexagonal structure was related to the reaction conditions and not only to a lower pressure of oxygen in the reactor, a partial pressure of \qty{5}{\milli\bar} of oxygen was set.
The following measurement showed the presence of many peaks that appeared in the first hour of the measurement (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt100C} - a)
A second map was measured directly after the end of the first map, in which none of the newly detected peaks could be detected (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt100C} - d)
These two measurements showed first that the hexagonal structure observed under reacting conditions with \qty{5}{\milli\bar} of oxygen is linked to the simultaneous presence of ammonia and oxygen in the reactor, and that the duration of some of the observed phenomena are too short to be effectively measured with the current time-resolution of in-plane reciprocal space maps.

\subsection{Surface roughness and surface relaxation effects}

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{/home/david/Documents/PhDScripts/SixS_2022_01_SXRD_Pt100/figures/ctr_a.pdf}

        Evolution of [100] crystal truncation rods measured perpendicular to three different Bragg peaks under different atmospheres.
    }
    \label{fig:CTRPt100}
\end{figure}

Crystal truncation rods have been measured perpendicularly to the ($\bar{1}\bar{1}0$), ($\bar{1}00$) and ($\bar{2}10$) positions \qty{6}{\hour} after the start of each condition, each measurement lasted for \qty{2}{\hour}.
The background-subtracted intensity of the CTR was integrated using the \textit{fitaid} module of \textit{binoculars} as a function of $L$ with the same integration range.
The CTR intensity is displayed in fig. \ref{fig:CTRPt100}, additional peaks are detected under exposition to \qty{80}{\milli\bar} of \ce{O_2}, which shows that bulk \ce{Pt_3O_4} is epitaxied on the Pt(100) surface.

Those peaks prevent us from resolving the minimal position of the CTR intensity, the absence of oscillations in the evolution of the CTR intensity as a function of $L$ also shows that there is no homogeneous layer of \ce{Pt_3O_4}, but rather many islands of different heights covering the substrate.

The catalyst surface can be divided in three different components as a function of $\vec{z}$.
First, there is bulk Pt(100) in which the structure is homogeneous.
Secondly, there is the interface between bulk platinum and the different islands of \ce{Pt_3O_4}, in which the platinum atoms are expected to be displaced from their equilibrium positions due to the interaction with the oxide layer, and where there could also be the presence of some subsurface oxygen atoms.
Thirdly, there are the \ce{Pt_3O_4} islands, on top of the previous layers, with different heights.
The deconvolution of the signals originating from the different layers is complicated due to the very large amount of parameters needed to properly simulate the CTR intensity, and the impossibility to simulate more than two different surface areas with \textit{ROD}.
A first approach to understanding the catalyst surface is discussed below.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{/home/david/Documents/PhDScripts/SixS_2022_01_SXRD_Pt100/figures/fit_8o2.pdf}
    \caption{
        Fitting results for crystal truncation rods collected under a \qty{80}{\milli\bar} of \ce{O_2}.
    }
    \label{fig:CTRFitHighOxygen}
\end{figure}

The structure factors $F_i$ resulting from the presence of one to nine unit cells on the Pt(100) surface of \ce{Pt_3O_4} was simulated with \textit{ROD}, the same interface with the substrate is used in each simulation, a $\beta$ roughness parameter of 0.6 was used.
The fitting routine consists in minimising the square root difference between the CTR structure factors $F_{obs}$ and the square root of the coherent sum of the squared simulated structure factors by adjusting the weight $W_i$ of each signal in the total signal $F_{calc}$ (eq. \ref{eq:Fcalc}).

\begin{equation}
    F_{calc} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{9} W_i F_i^2}
    \label{eq:Fcalc}
\end{equation}

The relation between each weight was adjusted by following a Gaussian distribution, expecting the different islands to not differ too much in height.
The result of the fitting routine is shown in fig. \ref{fig:CTRFitHighOxygen}, and show a Gaussian distribution centred around $3.6$ unit cells, with a standard deviation $\sigma$ equal to $1.3$ unit cells.
The position and width of the \ce{Pt_3O_4} peaks are well adjusted, the simulation struggles however to accurately reproduce the intensity when below a certain threshold.
The ratio of intensity between the \ce{Pt_3O_4} peaks is also not perfect and could be further adjusted by changing the type of oxide layer present at the interface as well as the distance between the oxide and surface.
There is a large difference when comparing the results with the average thickness of \qty{\approx 60}{\angstrom} given by fitting the $L$-scans in fig. \ref{fig:LScansHighOxygenPt100}, since each unit cell is expected to be \qty{\approx5.64}{\angstrom} thick.
Overall, the existence of bulk \ce{Pt_3O_4} islands is confirmed to remove the coherent fringes visible when a homogeneous layer is present of the sample surface (fig. \ref{fig:SimROD}).
\textcolor{Important}{try to give an explanation}

When observing the CTR intensity under other atmospheres, a clear evolution in the position of the minimum intensity between both reacting conditions (in red and green in fig. \ref{fig:CTRPt100}) is visible.
The CTR recorded after exposition to reacting conditions under ammonia or under argon have similar intensities and are almost indistinguishable.

All three CTR were fitted together using \textit{ROD} at each atmospheres besides the oxygen rich atmosphere, for which a surface model taking into account the existence of \ce{Pt_3O_4} islands as well as the relaxation of the topmosts platinum layers compatible with \textit{ROD} could not be derived.
Different models were tested, adding the possibility of in-plane lattice displacement did not show any improvement of the fit quality, and a simple surface model was kept consisting of two Pt(100) layers, each sharing an out-of-plane lattice displacement parameter, on top of bulk Pt(100).
The fitting results are shown in fig. \ref{fig:CTRFit100}.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

    }
    \label{fig:CTRFit100}
\end{figure}

The surface roughness evaluated \textit{via} the $\beta$ parameter in fig. \ref{fig:CTRFit100} (a) is consistent with the evolution of the CTR intensity in fig. \ref{fig:CTRPt100}.
A high roughness is already present after the exposition of the surface to Argon.
The average roughness after introducing a partial pressure of \qty{80}{\milli\bar} of oxygen in the cell could not be retrieved but seems to be at least equal to the roughness under Argon from observing the CTR signals.
The roughness under reacting conditions is higher than under Argon, these crystal truncation rods having been measured after the second introduction of ammonia in the cell, \textit{i.e.} after cleaning of the sample and a short exposition to a high oxygen atmosphere.
Lowering the amount of oxygen in the cell decreases the surface roughness, which stays at high values.
The lowest value is reached when oxygen is not present in the reactor anymore.
The presence of \qty{5}{\milli\bar} of oxygen after the ammonia oxidation cycle increases the surface roughness to higher values, almost equal to the maximum value under reacting conditions after the presence of \qty{80}{\milli\bar} of oxygen.

The strain of the second topmost layer, (B in fig. \ref{fig:CTRFit100} - b) is always very close to \qty{0}{\percent} besides interestingly under \qty{5}{\milli\bar} of oxygen.
The strain of the topmost layer (A in fig. \ref{fig:CTRFit100} - b) is always compressive and seen to increase during reacting conditions in comparison to under argon atmosphere.
A slight increase is reported when lowering the partial pressure of oxygen in the cell, whereas its removal leads to the lowest recorded strain values.

The ammonia oxidation cycle has shown to overall clean the sample surface with a clear difference in the sample roughness and out-of-plane strain before and after the reaction.
The lack of results under \qty{80}{\milli\bar} of oxygen without ammonia and the presence of compressive strain before the oxidation cycle under argon make it difficult to correlate reacting conditions with compressive strain.
A second cycle after observing the clean surface state would lift this unknown since the strain and roughness are minimal after the oxidation cycle.

\subsection{Surface species presence}

In order to link surface structure, surface moieties and reaction products, the Pt 4f, N 1s and O 1s XPS spectra were recorded at near ambient pressure at the B07 beamline (Diamond synchrotron), at \qty{450}{\degreeCelsius}.
The same order in the ammonia oxidation cycle was repeated as during the SXRD experiment, with the same ratio between reaction products.
No carrier gas is used to keep the total pressure constant, the reactant pressure is lowered to \qty{11}{\percent} of the pressure during the SXRD experiment as a compromise for surface photoelectron detection.
The conditions have been resumed in tab. \ref{tab:ConditionsXPS}.
The mass spectrometer available at the B07 beamline allows us to monitor the presence of the reactants and products close to the sample surface.
The pressure of gases going through the same aperture of the electron analyser is measured, presented in fig. \ref{fig:XPS100RGA}.

% Describe rga
Overall, the same products are observed as with Pt(111).
A high \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} ratio equal to \num{8} favours the production of \ce{NO} as expected, accompanied by a high amount of water
The production of \ce{NO} is higher than for Pt(111), no pressure of \ce{N_2} and \ce{N_2O} can be measured, showing a higher selectivity of the Pt(100) surface towards \ce{NO} that could not be measured from the RGA in SXRD experiments.
Approximately half of the pressure of ammonia is still detected, which means that the oxygen cannot be considered to be in excess, and that the complete oxidation of ammonia is probably limited by the availability of active sites.

Lowering the amount of oxygen by reducing the \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} ratio to \num{0.5} has the remarkable effect of shifting the reaction selectivity entirely towards \ce{N_2}, just like for the Pt(111) surface.
Water is also detected.
\ce{H_2} coming from the simultaneous dissociation of \ce{NH_3} can be measured, not observed under a higher pressure of oxygen, which means that this reaction is not favoured when oxygen is present in the reactor.
Oxygen being undetected by the mass spectrometer when the \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} ratio is equal to \num{0.5}, all of the introduced oxygen dissociates on the catalyst surface and participates in the production of \ce{N_2} and \ce{H_2O} via the oxidation reaction.
Ammonia can be thus considered to be in excess, and partly decomposing towards \ce{N_2}.
The surface sites are probably occupied mainly by nitrogen-rich species that cannot find a nearby oxygen or OH to react with, eventually decomposing towards nitrogen.

The removal of oxygen shows that more ammonia is consumed but without producing water.
Only the dissociation of ammonia happens on the catalyst surface, the production of nitrogen decreases even though more ammonia is consumed, but less than for the Pt(111) surface.
It is not clear why more nitrogen is produced under the presence of oxygen, when more ammonia is used for less production of \ce{N_2} after the removal of oxygen.

\subsubsection{N 1s and O 1s levels}

N 1s and O 1s levels were recorded to probe for the existence of specific surface species, allowing us to obtain more information about the reaction mechanism, and the link between surface state and selectivity.
The evolution of the N 1s and O 1s XPS spectra for different atmospheres is presented in fig. \ref{fig:O1sN1sPt100}.
Binding energy are given with reference to the Fermi level, all the reported peaks and corresponding species are detailed in tab. \ref{tab:XPSPt100}.

During the study of the oxidation of the Pt(100) by Derry et al. \parencite*{Derry1984}, O 1s peaks between \qty{530.4}{\eV} and \qty{530.5}{\eV} are reported as a function of the oxygen surface coverage.
Sugai et al \parencite*{Sugai1993} report a low intensity peak at \qty{531.5}{\eV} during the dissociation of \ce{NO} at \qty{400}{\degreeCelsius}, which they cannot specifically assign to either \ce{NO_a} or \ce{O_a}.
Different types of adsorbed oxygen species are observed during the dissociation of \ce{NO} by Rienks et al. \parencite*{Rienks2003} at \qty{527.7}{\eV} and \qty{529.7}{\eV}, the latter only shortly distant from \ce{NO_a} reported at \qty{529.8}{\eV}.
Kondratenko et al. \parencite*{Kondratenko2006} report \ce{O_a} and \ce{OH_a} at \qty{529.7}{\eV} and \qty{532}{\eV} respectively during the decomposition of \ce{N_2O} after exposition to \ce{H_2}, based on previous works by Wild et al. \parencite*{Wild2000}.

    \caption{Indexing of peaks measured during the oxidation of ammonia of the Pt(100) surface.}
\label{tab:XPSPt100}
\end{table}

% argon

% high ox
The Pt(100) surface was first exposed to \qty{8.8}{\milli\bar} of oxygen after argon.
The peaks at \qty{538.3}{\eV} and \qty{537.2}{\eV} can safely be attributed to \ce{O_{2,g}}, the positions are shifted in energy with respect to literature \parencite{Avval2022}.
By comparing with the reported literature values, the large peak at \qty{529.7}{\eV} is probably due to atomic oxygen adsorbed in different sites, explaining the wide peak shape.
No stable surface of bulk oxide was observed in SXRD at an oxygen pressure of \qty{5}{\milli\bar} which reduces the possibility of surface oxide peaks in the O 1s level.
\ce{Pt_3O_4} was only observed under \qty{80}{\milli\bar} of oxygen.
Some transient peaks (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt100C} - c) were measured with SXRD but disappeared after a few hours of measurements.
It is possible that the oxygen atoms within that surface structure yield some intensity around \qty{530.5}{\eV}, where a small region of higher intensity is observed.
No peak near \qty{527.7}{\eV} was observed throughout the experiment.

% ratio 8
Interestingly, adding ammonia in the cell does not remove the \ce{O_a} peak, but only introduces a \ce{H_2O_g} peak at \qty{533.7}{\eV} \parencite{Weststrate2006, Linford2019}, proving the catalytic activity.
The \ce{O_a} peak has a lower intensity which is partly due to the oxidation reaction utilising oxygen to produce almost only water and nitric oxide in this condition.
A peak at \qty{404.3}{\eV} is reported, linked mainly to \ce{NO_{g}} and possibly slightly to \ce{N_{2, g}}.
\ce{NO_{g}} is expected between \qty{404.5}{\eV} and \qty{406.7}{\eV}, while \ce{N_{2,g}} between \qty{403.9}{\eV} and \qty{404.8}{\eV} \parencite{Ivashenko2021}, which could possibly explain the broad peak shape.
% The fact that the partial pressure of \ce{NO} is higher than for Pt(111) tends to support this hypothesis.
Since gas phase peaks are shifting when changing the partial pressure of oxygen, it is difficult to be certain of the peak nature.
The presence of \ce{O_a} shows that oxygen is easily adsorbed in Pt(100), even when ammonia is present, \textit{i.e.} during reacting conditions.
Moreover, Novell-Leruth et al. \parencite*{NovellLeruth2008} have reported that the de-hydrogenation process of ammonia is favoured to occur \textit{via} \ce{O_a} rather than \ce{OH_a} on Pt(100) in comparison with Pt(111).
This could explain the surface high selectivity towards the production of \ce{NO}.
Furthermore, no additional peak that could be linked to \ce{OH_a} is observed, reported at \qty{532}{\eV} on Pt(100).
All the \ce{NH_x} species are probably quickly oxidised towards nitrogen, which then reacts with a neighbouring oxygen to form \ce{NO_a}.
Adsorbed \ce{NO} at \qty{401.3}{\eV} was not observed during the dissociation of \ce{NO} on Pt(100) above room temperature by XPS \parencite{Rienks2003}.
\ce{NO} probably desorbs too quickly from the catalyst surface to be detected in this study, as reported by Ivashenko et al. \parencite*{Ivashenko2021}.

% ratio 05
Reducing the partial pressure of oxygen induces a remarkable change in the O 1s spectrum, removing the \ce{O_a} peak, introducing a \ce{H_2O_a} peak at \qty{532.1}{\eV} and shifting the \ce{H_2O_g} peak by \qty{0.6}{\eV}.
It is difficult to differ between \ce{OH_a} and \ce{H_2O_a}.
If \ce{OH_a} is reported at \qty{532.0}{\eV}, such a peak also exists under argon atmosphere, characteristic of water contamination in the reactor.
An energy of \qty{400.0}{\eV} in the N 1s spectrum is linked to adsorbed atomic nitrogen on Pt(100) \parencite{Sugai1993, vandenBroek1999}.
Since the only product of the ammonia oxidation is now nitrogen, the peak at \qty{404.3}{\eV} can safely be assigned to \ce{N_{2,g}}, similar to reported values \parencite{Ivashenko2021}.
Ammonia being in excess, all of the oxygen is used during the oxidation of ammonia, yielding only \ce{H_2O} since no \ce{NO} or \ce{N_2O} can be detected, which explains the removal of the \ce{O_a} peak.
\ce{H_2} is also produced from the dissociation of \ce{NH_3} on the catalyst, adsorbed hydrogen atoms then recombine and desorb from the surface.
This reaction is only observed without oxygen in the reactor.
All of the oxygen is used in the first steps of the ammonia oxidation to remove hydrogen atoms from \ce{NH_x} species.
When \ce{OH_a} groups recombine to produce water, one oxygen atom is left on the catalyst surface.
It seems that the oxygen atoms are preferably used for the de-hydrogenation process rather than the formation of \ce{NO} by reacting with adsorbed nitrogen.
The recombination of two nitrogen atoms on the catalyst surface is probably a slow process since \ce{N_a} can be detected, but faster than the reaction with adsorbed oxygen at low \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} ratios.
At this condition, most of the surface sites are hypothesised to be occupied by adsorbed water or nitrogen.
\ce{NH_{3,g}} reported between \qty{400.4}{\eV} and \qty{400.7}{\eV} \parencite{Ivashenko2021}, was not clearly detected.
Nevertheless, it is possible that it also gives a contribution to the peak at \qty{400.0}{\eV}.

% ammonia
Removing oxygen from the reactor removes the gas phase water peak from the O 1s level, adsorbed water is still present but shifted in energy, with the same peak shape, maybe from a lower presence of \ce{OH_a} groups since no more oxygen is present.
The dissociation of ammonia towards \ce{N_2} and \ce{H_2} is measured with the mass spectrometer.
\ce{N_{2,g}} is measured, shifted by \qty{0.6}{\eV}.
The peak at \qty{400.6}{\eV} can tentatively be linked to a superposition of gas phase ammonia and adsorbed \ce{NH_{x,a}} species.
No \ce{N_a} peak can be observed which supports a slow dissociation process of ammonia of the Pt(100) surface.

% low o2
Removing ammonia and adding \qty{0.55}{\milli\bar} of oxygen in the reactor shows at least five peaks in the O 1s level.
Both peaks at \qty{538.3}{\eV} and \qty{537.2}{\eV} are from gas phase oxygen.
At least three different oxygen species are present on the catalyst.
The peak at \qty{529.7}{\eV} exhibits a high intensity and low width, attributed to the presence of chemisorbed oxygen on Pt(100), mainly responsible for the de-hydrogenation steps.
At least two other peaks can be detected at higher energy, around \qty{530.6}{\eV} and \qty{531.4}{\eV}.
If only one peak was present at \qty{531.4}{\eV} the intensity would drop between at \qty{530.6}{\eV} which is not the case here.
\ce{OH_a} reported at \qty{532}{\eV} \parencite{Kondratenko2006} is too far from the energies indexed here to be linked to the peak at \qty{531.4}{\eV}.
Thus, various oxygen species, adsorbed on different sites (e.g. hollow, on-top, bridge) or in different layers of the catalyst may be linked to the peaks at \qty{532.0}{\eV}, \qty{531.4}{\eV}.
The oxygen specie at \qty{529.7}{\eV} is predominant compared to the other species, only that specie could be resolved during reacting conditions.
Thus, the oxidation of ammonia may prevent the other species from existing due to the high mobility of adsorbed atoms on the catalyst surface.

\subsubsection{Pt 4f level}

The Pt 4f level was also measured to report possible differences in the electronic configuration of surface platinum atoms.
No bulk oxide could be measured during reacting conditions or under the presence of \qty{5}{\milli\bar} of oxygen.
However, many different surface structures were identified under reacting conditions, changing as a function of the \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} ratio (fig. \ref{fig:MapsAndLScansPt100HighOxAmmonia} - \ref{fig:MapsAndLScansPt100LowOxAmmonia}).

\end{figure}

The introduction of \qty{8.8}{\milli\bar} of oxygen in the reactor induces a shift of \qty{0.1}{\eV} in the main peak position.
Two new peaks can be detected, at \qty{71.8}{\eV} and \qty{71.4}{\eV}, probably linked to the presence of oxygen atoms on top of the catalyst surface.
One new peak was clearly identified to appear in the O 1s level during this condition at \qty{529.7}{\eV}, linked to chemisorbed oxygen based on reported literature values \parencite{Rienks2003, Kondratenko2006}.
One of both peaks at \qty{71.8}{\eV} and \qty{71.4}{\eV} is probably from the same specie.
The other Pt 4f peak may be linked to the moieties yielding a small peak near \qty{530.5}{\eV} in the O 1s level.
The presence of \ce{OH_a} on the surface is likely since it is involved in the reaction mechanism, and could correspond to this second specie.

Introducing ammonia shifts the main peak to lower binding energy, possibly from the appearance of a new peak linked to nitrogen species.
Both peaks identified under oxygen do not disappear but have a decreased intensity, similarly to what has been observed in the O 1s level, as a result of the participation of oxygen species in the catalytic reaction.

Reducing the partial pressure of oxygen to \qty{0.55}{\milli\bar} has the effect of removing the oxygen induced features at high binding energy.
The peak tail near \qty{71.5}{\eV} closely resembles that observed under argon atmosphere.
The \ce{O_a} peaks in the O 1s level also disappeared during this condition.
Interestingly, the peak shape is broader and extended towards lower binding energy, where a contribution of adsorbed nitrogen atoms detected in the N 1s level, is possible.
If \ce{N_a} could not be detected when the \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} = 8, it is not possible to rule out its presence due to the low intensity of the XPS spectrum.
Thus, the shift towards lower energy in the Pt 4f level may be due to adsorbed nitrogen for both conditions, more important when \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} = 0.5.
Indeed, removing oxygen from the reactor which removed the \ce{N_a} peak from the N 1s level also reverts this broadening effect.

The same reasoning can be applied to adsorbed water, which appears at the same condition but does not disappear when removing oxygen.
However, the energy position in the O 1s level is slightly shifted, from \qty{532.1}{\eV} to \qty{532.4}{\eV}, which underlines different electronic environments.

A new peak near \qty{71.6}{\eV} under the sole presence of ammonia can safely be attributed to the presence of adsorbed \ce{NH_{x,a}} species, also identified in the N 1s level.
The peak intensity with respect to the maximum intensity is the highest measured, translating a large coverage of the platinum surface by \ce{NH_{x,a}}.

Changing the reactor atmosphere to \qty{0.55}{\milli\bar} of oxygen has removed the peak at \qty{71.6}{\eV}.
Overall the peak shape is similar to that under \qty{8.8}{\milli\bar} of oxygen.
The weaker intensity at higher binding energy is probably linked to a lower oxidised state of the Pt surface.

Reverting to argon atmosphere removed the peaks linked to \ce{O_a}.
However, the peak has not completely reverted to its shape before the oxidation cycle, and is very similar to the shape under a \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} ratio equal to \num{0.5}.
The adsorbed nitrogen is absent from the Pt surface, only adsorbed water is present at both conditions, which was also present before the oxidation cycle but in a lower amount.
Therefore, adsorbed water may be the specie giving rise to the peak at lower binding energy.
