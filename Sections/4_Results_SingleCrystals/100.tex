\section{Pt(100) single crystal studied at \qty{450}{\degreeCelsius}} \label{sec:SXRD100}

A similar experiment was carried out on a Pt(100) sample.
The arrangement of the Pt atoms on this surface is square, the distance between in-plane neighbouring Pt atoms is smaller than between out-of-plane atoms.
A surface unit cell must be derived, shown in fig. \ref{fig:SurfaceUnitCellPt100}, to represent the surface arrangement of the Pt atoms with the smallest unit vectors possible.
The in-plane vectors $\vec{a}_{(100)}$ and $\vec{b}_{(100)}$ are of equal magnitude ($a_{Pt} / \sqrt{2} = \qty{2.77}{\angstrom})$, separated by \ang{90}.
The out-of-plane vector $\vec{c}_{(100)}$ is perpendicular to the (100) plane, and of magnitude $a_{Pt} = \qty{3.92}{\angstrom}$.

\end{SCfigure}

Reciprocal space in-plane maps were collected to probe the structural evolution of the sample during ammonia oxidation, using the same experimental setup and atmospheres as for Pt(111) (tab. \ref{tab:ConditionsSXRD}).
Considering the square symmetry in the position of the Bragg peaks, the in-plane reciprocal space maps were collected by rotating the in-plane sample and detector angles ($\mu$ and $\gamma$) from \ang{0} to \ang{90} to collect a quarter of the reciprocal space in the ($\vec{q}_x$, $\vec{q}_y$) plane

The reciprocal space in-plane maps were computed in ($hkl$)-space (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt100A}) to visualise the arrangement of surface structures or surface relaxations in comparison with the hexagonal surface unit cell described in fig. \ref{fig:SurfaceUnitCellPt100}.

\subsection{Oxide growth under 80 mbar of oxygen}

    \caption{
        Reciprocal space in-plane maps collected under different atmospheres at \qty{450}{\degreeCelsius}, computed using the surface lattice of Pt(100).
    }
    \label{fig:MapsPt100A}
\end{figure}

The first map was collected under \qty{500}{\milli\bar} of Ar, after the cleaning of the sample by sputtering and annealing (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt100A} - a).
The (200), (1$\bar{1}$0) and (0$\bar{2}$0) Bragg peaks can be observed, together with the intersection of the [1, 0, L] and [0, $\bar{1}$, L] CTRs with the [H, K, 0] plane (circled in white).

The sample was then first exposed to \qty{80}{\milli\bar} of oxygen, while keeping the total pressure to \qty{500}{\milli\bar} by compensation with argon (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt100A} - b).
The signals generated by the rich oxygen condition can be divided into two groups, identified by red and green circles.
The red peaks are situated approximately at [H, K] = [1, -0.5], [H, K] = [1, -1.5], [H, K] = [0.5, $\bar{1}$] and [H, K] = [0.5, -1.5].
These signal follow a Pt(100)-($2\times2$) reconstruction, keeping in mind that it is related to surface unit cell of Pt(100).
A ($2\times2$) reconstruction of the Pt(100) surface has been reported for nanoparticles measured under \qty{1e-3}{\milli\bar} of oxygen, by the use of environmental TEM \parencite{Li2016}.

The green peaks are slightly shifted from the red peaks by the same amount $\delta = 0.07$ in either H or K.
No simple surface unit cell could be derived from their in-plane positions.

Two super structure rods (SSRs) were performed on each group of signal, up to $L=3.5$, to probe the related out-of-plane structure.
The background-subtracted intensity was integrated as a function of $L$ using the \textit{fitaid} module of \textit{BINoculars} (fig. \ref{fig:LScansHighOxygenPt100}), following the same kind of procedure performed on Pt(111).

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{/home/david/Documents/PhD/PhDScripts/SixS_2022_01_SXRD_Pt100/figures/l_scans_high_oxygen_no_map.pdf}
    \caption{
        SSRs for four different positions in [H, K] under \qty{80}{\milli\bar} of \ce{O_2}, and \qty{420}{\milli\bar} of \ce{Ar}.
    }
    \label{fig:LScansHighOxygenPt100}
\end{figure}

The intensity distribution as a function of $L$ for the shifted peaks quickly decreases down to zero, which shows they correspond to flat monolayers (simulation example in fig. \ref{fig:SimROD}, Robinson et al. \cite*{Robinson1991}).
However, four peaks at different $L$ values are visible on both SSRs measured on the Pt(100)-($2\times2$) reconstruction in fig. \ref{fig:LScansHighOxygenPt100}, including at $L=0$, which is characteristic of a bulk structure, \textit{i.e.} more than a few unit cells thick (simulation example also in fig. \ref{fig:SimROD}, Robinson et al. \cite*{Robinson1991}).
The peaks were fitted using a model with four Gaussian peaks and a constant background, the same full width at half maxima was used for all four peaks since they are assumed to be linked to the same structure (fig. \ref{fig:FitPt100LScans}).
A $r^2$ value of \num{0.86} and \num{0.98} was reached for the SSRs at [H, K] = [0.5, $\bar{1}$], and [H, K] = [0.5, -1.5], respectively.
In the second fit, the maximum value of each peak is better represented which explains the difference in the $r^2$ values.

Corresponding interplanar spacings were computed from the position of the peaks, corresponding to a slightly distorted cubic unit cell with an in-plane lattice parameter equal to \qty{5.60}{\angstrom}, and an out-of-plane lattice parameter equal to \qty{5.64}{\angstrom}.
This unit cell was used to index each Bragg peak in fig. \ref{fig:FitPt100LScans}.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

        The different peaks were indexed using a distorted cubic structure, corresponding to bulk \ce{Pt_3O_4}, $d$ are the corresponding interplanar spacings.
    }
    \label{fig:FitPt100LScans}
\end{figure}

\ce{Pt_3O_4} has a cubic structure (space group $P_{m\bar{3}n}$) with a lattice parameter equal to \qty{5.65}{\angstrom} \parencite{Galloni1941, Galloni1952, Muller1968}, presented in fig. \ref{fig:Pt3O4}.
Recent theoretical studies have proposed a lattice parameter equal to \qty{5.59}{\angstrom}, (tab. \ref{tab:PtOxides}, Seriani et al. \cite*{Seriani2006}), which is also close to the values reported in this study.
Moreover, the (212) and (232) reflections are not allowed for the proposed due to the symmetry of the \ce{Pt_3O_4} structure.
Those reflections are indeed absent from fig. \ref{fig:FitPt100LScans}.

\begin{SCfigure}

        Platinum atoms are situated on the faces on the cubic unit cell (e.g. $(0, 1/2, 1/4)$, $(0, 1/2, 3/4)$), while the eight oxygen atoms are inside the unit cell at the positions $(1/4, 1/4, z)$, $(1/4, 2/4, z)$, $(2/4, 1/4, z)$, $(2/4, 2/4, z)$ for $z=1/4$ and $z=3/4$.
    }
    \label{fig:Pt3O4}
\end{SCfigure}

The lattice parameter of \ce{Pt_3O_4} is approximately twice that of the Pt(100) surface lattice parameter, which allows the formation of a cubic on cubic coherent interface.
The nature of the atoms at the interface is addressed later in this chapter.
To match perfectly with the Pt(100) surface, the in-plane lattice parameter of \ce{Pt_3O_4} would need to reach the value of $2\times a_{100} =\qty{5.55}{\angstrom}$, which is lower than the reported literature values for the cubic unit cell.
This interfacial strain can be the reason for the distorted structure observed in this study.
The possibility to perform out-of-plane measurements with SXRD allows us to link the Pt(100)-($2\times2$) reconstruction with certainty to bulk \ce{Pt_3O_4}, which exhibits a slightly distorted lattice.

A first estimate of the oxide layer thickness can be obtained with the full-width at half maxima of the Bragg peaks in $q_z$: $FWHM_{q_z}$, and using the equation $2\pi/FWHM_{q_z}$ \parencite{Patterson1939, Warren1990}.
This yields a thickness of \qty{\approx 16.3}{\angstrom}, which for bulk \ce{Pt_3O_4} would correspond to approximately \num{3} unit cells.

\subsection{Near ambient pressure ammonia oxidation cycle}

    }
    \label{fig:MapsPt100B}
\end{figure}

The combination of high temperature, oxygen and ammonia define a very harsh environment, that can result in the oxidation of the screws responsible for the contact on the sample holder.
Fig \ref{fig:MapsPt100B} (a) shows a map in which the heating system failed after the introduction of ammonia in the reactor, reaching reacting conditions.
Nevertheless, half of the large reciprocal space in-plane maps could be measured, the red circled peaks corresponding to \ce{Pt_3O_4} are still visible, showing that \ce{Pt_3O_4} is not immediately removed during reacting condition.
The two other peaks at [0.93, -0.5] and [0.5, -0.93] have disappeared, the related structure is not stable during the reaction.

After repair of the sample heater, the sample was cleaned by sputtering and annealing cycles, and replaced in the reactor.
In order to probe for the reproducibility of the \ce{Pt_3O_4} growth on the surface, the partial pressure of oxygen was set to \qty{80}{\milli\bar}, while measuring a small area of the reciprocal space to detect the same peaks (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt100A} - b).
Such peaks could indeed be detected, but with a shift between the green and red groups of peaks equal to $0.09$, more important than the previously measured value of $0.07$.
The second structure is possibly linked to the exposure to oxygen atmosphere, the smaller in-plane map was collected faster, and directly after the introduction of oxygen in the reactor.

Ammonia was subsequently introduced in the cell to probe the relation between surface structure and selectivity during ammonia oxidation.

\end{figure}

Signals separated by $0.1$ in H or in K were observed around the platinum Bragg peaks in a square arrangement, compatible with a Pt(100)-($10\times10$) surface reconstruction.
Most of the peaks are observed at $H={0,1,2}$ or $K={0, -1}$ (fig. \ref{fig:MapsAndLScansPt100HighOxAmmonia} - a).
The other features are observed in rows or columns \textit{shifted} by $0.09$ with respect to the (1, $\bar{1}$, 0) Bragg peak, following the shift of the green circled peaks observed while only oxygen is present in the cell (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt100B} - b).

SSRs at [H, K] = [1.9, 0], [H, K] = [0.5,  $\bar{1}$], and [H, K] = [0, -1.2] are performed on the Pt(100)-($10\times10$) reconstructions (fig. \ref{fig:MapsAndLScansPt100HighOxAmmonia} - b).
The peaks measured earlier at [H, K] = [0.5, $\bar{1}$] at $L=0.7$, $L=1.4$, and $L=2.1$ corresponding to bulk \ce{Pt_3O_4} are no longer visible.
For [H, K] = [1.9, 0], two peaks are visible near $L=0.15$ and $L=2.15$.
The reconstructed signal effectively disappears near $L=1.9$, but reappears with a strong intensity at $L=2$, following the same decrease as a function of $L$ as from $L=0$.
For [H, K] = [0, -1.2], large oscillations are visible with a minimum at $L=1.2$, which could be the signature of a multi-layer structure (e.g. simulated \ce{Pt_3O4} in fig. \ref{fig:SimROD} - a).
Large oscillations are also visible for [H, K] = [0.5, -1], with a minimum between $L=1$ and $L=1.7$, and local maxima at $L=0.4$, and $L=2.5$.

The SSR at [H, K] = [0.5, -0.91] (fig. \ref{fig:MapsAndLScansPt100HighOxAmmonia} - b) is performed on the shifted Pt(100)-($10\times10$) reconstruction.
The intensity decreases gradually with increasing $L$, characteristic of a monolayer, no signal can be detected above $L=2$.
Note that such an intensity decrease was also observed for the shifted peak at [H, K] = [0.5, -0.93] in the previous condition (fig. \ref{fig:FitPt100LScans}).

It is not certain that the same thickness of \ce{Pt_3O_4} was present on the catalyst surface at the beginning of the reacting conditions.
Indeed, the sample was exposed to \qty{80}{\milli\bar} of oxygen for \qty{6}{\hour} before SSRs could be measured.
The second exposition only lasted for \qty{1}{\hour}, during which the same in-plane peaks could effectively be measured, but without out-of-plane information.
The thickness of \ce{Pt_3O_4} is very likely to be related to the time spent under \qty{80}{\milli\bar} of \ce{O_2}.
However, it is clear that i) new signals appear during reacting conditions, related to structures that themselves differ depending on the thickness of \ce{Pt_3O_4}, and ii) the bulk oxide cannot grow under reacting conditions.
Therefore, different types of structures coexist on the Pt(100) surface when the \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} ratio is equal to \num{8}, possibly linked to different adsorbed species participating in the catalytic reaction.

Lowering the partial pressure of oxygen from \qty{80}{\milli\bar} to \qty{5}{\milli\bar} in the reactor has completely removed the Pt(100)-($10\times10$) reconstruction (fig. \ref{fig:MapsAndLScansPt100LowOxAmmonia} - a).

Co-existing domains with the same hexagonal lattice on top on the Pt(100) surface are revealed, with an in-plane lattice parameter equal to \qty{2.68}{\angstrom}, \qty{\approx 3.36}{\percent} lower than the distance between neighbouring Pt atoms on the Pt(100) surface (\qty{2.77}{\angstrom}).
Second order peaks can also be seen at the borders of the reciprocal space in-plane map, each domain has one axis parallel to either $\vec{a}_{(100)}$ or $\vec{b}_{(100)}$.

The hexagonal structures can be described as follows: Pt(100)-p$\begin{pmatrix} 0.96 & 0.00\\ -0.48 & 0.83 \end{pmatrix}$.

Different hexagonal surface structures on the Pt(100) surface have been reported in literature, in the same directions, and under ultra-high vacuum.
This has been summarised by Hammer et al. \parencite*{Hammer2016}, based on an important body of work \parencite{Heilmann1979, Vanhove1981, Heinz1982, Mase1992, Kuhnke1992, Borg1994, VanBeurden2004, Havu2010}.
Hexagonal structures have been measured to evolve to rotated hexagonal reconstructions with angles between \ang{0.77} and \ang{0.94} depending on the sample temperature, and the previous temperature treatment.
The unit cell describing those reconstructions with respect to the Pt(100) surface varies, if first contained to (5XN) where N = 20–30, the latest study reports a c(26x118) superstructure.
Exposition of the rotated hexagonal structures to oxygen at \qty{450}{\degreeCelsius} studied by low energy electron diffraction (LEED) removes the hexagonal structures, and precipitate the growth of surface oxides \textit{via} different phases \parencite{BradleyShumbera2007, BradleyShumbera2007a}.
A similar conclusion was reached by \cite{Deskins2005} by DFT studies.
Exposition to \ce{NO} has been reported to stabilise the clean Pt(100) phase \parencite{Heinz1982}, while exposition to \ce{CO} removes the hexagonal reconstruction.
An oscillatory behaviour between a clean Pt(100)-(1x1) surface and the rotated hexagonal reconstruction was reported by Cox et al. \parencite*{Cox1983} during CO oxidation.

Subsurface oxygen has also been predicted to exist on Pt(100) \parencite{Gu2007}, reported at a pressure of \qty{0.133}{\milli\bar} \parencite{McMillan2005}, and participating in the catalytic oxidation of \ce{CO}.
It was identified as a precursor to a stable surface oxide during the catalytic oxidation of \ce{CO} by Dicke et al. \parencite*{Dicke2000}, at an oxygen pressure of \qty{0.09}{\milli\bar}.
The appearance of subsurface oxygen was linked to the lifting of surface reconstructions on the clean Pt(100) surface from the adsorption of \ce{CO}, which then allowed oxygen atoms to penetrate under the topmost layer of platinum \parencite{Rotermund1993, Lauterbach1994}.

Overall, few works at ambient pressure have been found to exist, even less during the catalytic oxidation of ammonia.
SSRs were collected at the position of the two peaks (fig. \ref{fig:MapsAndLScansPt100LowOxAmmonia} - b), no bulk structure could be detected.
A different behaviour is measured when lowering the \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} ratio from \num{8} to \num{0.5}, which also has an impact on the product selectivity.
The partial pressure of \ce{NO} and \ce{N_2O} decreases quickly after the change of condition (fig. \ref{fig:RGA450Pt100Cycle}), whereas the partial pressure of \ce{N_2} is more stable.

After removing oxygen from the reactor, only the first order reflections corresponding to the hexagonal structures could be detected during the measurement of the reciprocal space in-plane map (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt100C} - a), the following measurement under Argon showed a clean Pt(100) surface (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt100C} - b).

\end{figure}

To make sure that the hexagonal structures are related to the reaction conditions, and not only to a lower pressure of oxygen in the reactor, a partial pressure of \qty{5}{\milli\bar} of oxygen was set.
The following measurement showed the presence of many peaks that appeared in the first hour of the measurement (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt100D} - a).
A second map was measured directly after the end of the first map, in which none of the newly detected peaks could be observed (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt100D} - b).

These two measurements showed first that the hexagonal structures observed under reacting conditions when the \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} ratio is equal to \num{0.5} are linked to the \textit{simultaneous} presence of ammonia and oxygen in the reactor.
Secondly, the dynamics of some of the observed phenomena under \qty{5}{\milli\bar} of oxygen are too short to be effectively measured with the current time-resolution of in-plane reciprocal space maps.
Weak signals in the H and K directions can be seen in the second map, starting from the (1, $\bar{1}$, 0) Bragg peak (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt100D} - b).

\subsection{Surface roughness and surface relaxation effects}

        Evolution of crystal truncation rods under different atmospheres.
    }
    \label{fig:CTRPt100}
\end{figure}

The (20L), ($1\bar{1}L$) and (0$\bar{1}L$) crystal truncation rods have been measured \qty{6}{\hour} after the start of each condition, each measurement lasted for \qty{2}{\hour}.
The background-subtracted intensity of the CTR was integrated using the \textit{fitaid} module of \textit{BINoculars} as a function of $L$ with the same integration range.
The CTR intensity is displayed in fig. \ref{fig:CTRPt100}, additional peaks are detected under exposition to \qty{80}{\milli\bar} of \ce{O_2}, confirming that bulk \ce{Pt_3O_4} is epitaxied on the Pt(100) surface following a Pt(100)-($2\times2$) arrangement.

Those peaks prevent us from resolving the minimal position of the CTR intensity, highly sensitive to surface relaxation effects.
The absence of oscillations in the evolution of the CTR intensity as a function of $L$ also shows that \ce{Pt_3O_4} is not homogeneously covering the Pt(100) substrate (such signal is presented in fig. \ref{fig:SimROD} - b).
This phenomena is here explained by \ce{Pt_3O_4} islands of different thickness covering the substrate, the fringes linked to islands of same thickness being smeared out from the contribution of others.

The catalyst surface can be divided in three different components as a function of $\vec{z}$.
First, bulk Pt(100).
Secondly, the interface between bulk platinum and the different islands of \ce{Pt_3O_4}, in which the platinum atoms are expected to be displaced from their equilibrium positions due to the interaction with the oxide layer.
% , and where there could also be the presence of some subsurface oxygen atoms.
Thirdly, the \ce{Pt_3O_4} islands, on top of the previous layers, with different thickness.
A first approach to approximate the catalyst surface is discussed below.

The structure factors $F_i$ resulting from the presence of one to nine unit cells of \ce{Pt_3O_4} on the Pt(100) surface was simulated with \textit{ROD}, the same interface with the substrate is used in each simulation.
The fitting routine consists in minimising the square root difference between the CTR structure factors $F_{obs}$, and the square root of the squared simulated structure factors sum by adjusting the weight $W_i$ of each signal in the total signal $F_{calc}$ (eq. \ref{eq:Fcalc}).

\begin{equation}
    F_{calc} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{9} W_i F_i^2}
    \label{eq:Fcalc}
\end{equation}

% Structure factors resulting from different domains are not coherently interfere since the beam in grazing incidence, the beam the distance between each domain may be larger than the beam coherence lengths.

In this first hypothesis, the topmost Pt(100) layers were assumed to be strain free.
Different $\beta$ roughness parameters (explained in fig. \ref{fig:CTRSimulation}) were used, the best fit is with $\beta = \num{0.6}$.
The $\beta$ roughness parameter only lowers the intensity of the bulk signal and not that of the surface layers.
Moreover, it is assumed that \ce{Pt_3O_4} islands have the same out-of-plane and in-plane lattice parameter in each layer, independently of the island thickness.
For example, the 7$^{th}$ unit cell in a \num{8} unit cell thick island has the same lattice parameters than the second unit cell in a \num{4} unit cell thick island.

The relation between each weight was adjusted by following a Gaussian distribution, expecting the different islands to not differ too much in thickness.
The result of the fitting routine is shown in fig. \ref{fig:CTRFitHighOxygen}, with a Gaussian distribution centred around $0$ unit cells, and with a standard deviation $\sigma$ equal to $2$ unit cells.
The presence and width of the \ce{Pt_3O_4} peaks is well adjusted, see for example the presence of the (405) \ce{Pt_3O_4} Bragg peak in the [2, 0, L] CTR.
The intensity shape near the platinum Bragg peak is also quite accurate, but tends to fall too quickly.
This can be adjusted by lowering the $\beta$ roughness, but low intensity regions then become impossible to represent.
Indeed, the simulation struggles to accurately reproduce the intensity when below a certain threshold.
The position of some peaks is very well reproduced, but some peaks are a little shifted, such as the (402) and (2$\bar{2}2$) \ce{Pt_3O_4} Bragg peaks in the [2, 0, L], and [1, $\bar{1}$, L] CTRs.
The ratio of intensity between the \ce{Pt_3O_4} peaks is also not perfect, and could possibly be further adjusted by changing the type of atoms present at the interface, as well as the distance between the oxide and surface.
The positions of the Pt atoms at the interface are explained by a sketch in fig. \ref{fig:Pt3O4onPt100}.

The distance between the Pt atoms in the Pt(100) bulk and \ce{Pt_3O_4} was chosen equal to \num{0.5} unit cell lattice length, following the spacing between Pt atoms in \{100\} planes.
The fitting result may be further improved by adjusting this parameter, as well as the interfacial strain.
Overall, the existence of bulk \ce{Pt_3O_4} islands is confirmed to remove the oscillations visible when a homogeneous layer is present of the sample surface (fig. \ref{fig:SimROD}).
Moreover, the average thickness retrieved by fitting the SSRs in fig. \ref{fig:LScansHighOxygenPt100}, \qty{\approx16.3}{\angstrom}, \textit{i.e.} 3 unit cells, is in good agreement with the mean value and standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution returned here.

When observing the CTR intensity under other atmospheres, a clear evolution in the position of the minimum intensity between both reacting conditions (in red and green in fig. \ref{fig:CTRPt100}) is visible.
The CTR recorded after exposition to reacting conditions under ammonia or under argon have similar intensities and are almost indistinguishable.

All three CTRs were fitted together using \textit{ROD}, at each condition besides the oxygen rich atmosphere.
Different models were tested, adding the possibility of in-plane lattice displacement did not show any improvement of the fit quality, and a simple surface model was kept consisting of two Pt(100) layers, each sharing an out-of-plane lattice displacement parameter, on top of bulk Pt(100).
The evolution of the surface roughness and out-of-plane strain is shown in fig. \ref{fig:CTRFit100}, the $C$ layer is the topmost layer, the $A$ layer is in the bulk.

The surface roughness evaluated \textit{via} the $\beta$ parameter in fig. \ref{fig:CTRFit100} (a) is consistent with the evolution of the CTR intensity in fig. \ref{fig:CTRPt100}.
The initial value for the surface roughness is equal to \num{0.44} when exposed to a total pressure of argon equal to \qty{500}{\milli\bar}.
The average roughness after introducing a partial pressure of \qty{80}{\milli\bar} of oxygen was estimated to increase to \num{0.6}, coherent with the creation of a bulk oxide layer on the sample surface.
The minimal intensity can be seen to decrease after introduction of oxygen, see for example at $L=1$ for the [$\bar{1}$, $\bar{1}$, L] CTR in fig. \ref{fig:CTRPt100}.

The following crystal truncation rods having been measured after the second introduction of ammonia in the cell, \textit{i.e.} after sample cleaning and short exposition to high oxygen atmosphere.
The roughness under reacting conditions, when observing the Pt(100)-($10\times10$) reconstructions (fig. \ref{fig:MapsAndLScansPt100HighOxAmmonia}), decreases only slightly in comparison to having only oxygen in the cell, and is still more important than under inert atmosphere.
Lowering the amount of oxygen in the cell decreases the surface roughness, coming back to the initial value.
In this condition, the hexagonal structures are observed (fig. \ref{fig:MapsAndLScansPt100LowOxAmmonia}).

The lowest roughness value is reached when only ammonia is present in the reactor, without oxygen.
The hexagonal structures slowly disappear (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt100C}), their presence linked to increased roughness on the sample surface.
Removing ammonia does not change the surface roughness, which shows that oxygen plays a key role in the increased surface roughness.

Finally, the presence of \qty{5}{\milli\bar} of oxygen after the ammonia oxidation cycle increases the surface roughness to higher values, almost equal to the maximum value reached under the presence of \qty{80}{\milli\bar} of oxygen.
Bulk \ce{Pt_3O_4} was not observed in this condition, small peaks were visible linked to transient structures (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt100D}).

% strain
The strain of the second topmost layer, ($B$ in fig. \ref{fig:CTRFit100} - b) is always very close to \qty{0}{\percent}.
The strain of the topmost layer ($C$ in fig. \ref{fig:CTRFit100} - b) is always compressive with respect to bulk parameters, and seen to increase during reacting conditions in comparison with the initial values under argon atmosphere.
A slight increase is reported when changing the \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} ratio from \num{8} to \num{0.5}.
Keeping only ammonia in the reactor after the oxidation reaction brings the lowest strain observed, both layers almost exhibit the bulk lattice parameters.

The presence of ammonia can be associated with reduced roughness and strain, whereas the presence of oxygen is associated with increased roughness and strain.
Different reacting conditions, which can be linked to a different selectivity in the product, show a larger difference in the surface roughness than in the surface strain.
For example, when observing the [2, 0, L] CTR in fig. \ref{fig:CTRFit100}, the local minima positions do not show a significant change.
However, the change in intensity indicates different surface roughness.
The shape of the [0, $\bar{1}$, L] CTR when the \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} ratio is equal to \num{0.5} is interesting (fig. \ref{fig:CTRPt100}).
The intensity minimum at $L=2.1$ is very low, whereas the decrease of intensity around the Bragg peaks is not very strong, in comparison with the same CTR but when the \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} ratio is equal to \num{8}.
It is possible that low intensity peaks are present near $L=1.8$ or $L=2.5$ that would explain this shape, linked to the hexagonal structures observed in fig. \ref{fig:MapsAndLScansPt100LowOxAmmonia}.

\subsection{Surface species}

As for the Pt(111), the Pt(100) crystal was measured with NAP-XPS at B07 beamline.
The conditions have been resumed in tab. \ref{tab:ConditionsXPS}.
The RGA signals are presented in fig. \ref{fig:XPS100RGA}.

% Describe rga
The high \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} ratio favours the production of \ce{NO} as expected, accompanied by water.
With the gas probe near the sample surface, it is possible to detect a different selectivity between the two surfaces: for the high oxygen condition Pt(100) produces mostly NO, whereas \ce{N_2} was still detected for Pt(111) (fig. \ref{fig:XPS111RGA}).
% No \ce{N_2} or \ce{N_2O} can be measured.

Lowering the amount of oxygen by reducing the \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} ratio to \num{0.5} has the remarkable effect of shifting the reaction selectivity entirely towards \ce{N_2}, just like for the Pt(111) surface.
Oxygen being undetected by the mass spectrometer, all of the available oxygen at the surface dissociates on the catalyst surface and participates in the production of \ce{N_2} and \ce{H_2O} \textit{via} the oxidation reaction.
\ce{H_2} coming from the simultaneous dissociation of \ce{NH_3} can also be measured, not observed under a higher pressure of oxygen.
Thus, the more oxygen is present in the reactor, the less the dissociation of \ce{NH_3} is favoured.
Ammonia can be considered to be in excess, and partly decomposing towards \ce{N_2}.

Under pure ammonia there is still production of \ce{N_2}, with an increase in \ce{H_2} production and essentially no \ce{H_2O} yield.

\subsubsection{N 1s and O 1s levels}

The evolution of the N 1s and O 1s XPS spectra for different atmospheres is presented in fig. \ref{fig:O1sN1sPt100}.
Binding energy are given with reference to the Fermi level, all the reported peaks and corresponding species are detailed in tab. \ref{tab:XPSPt100}.

During the study of the Pt(100) oxidation by Derry et al. \parencite*{Derry1984}, O 1s peaks between \qty{530.4}{\eV} and \qty{530.5}{\eV} are reported as a function of the oxygen surface coverage.
Sugai et al \parencite*{Sugai1993} report a low intensity peak at \qty{531.5}{\eV} during the dissociation of \ce{NO} at \qty{400}{\degreeCelsius}, which they cannot specifically assign to either \ce{NO_a} or \ce{O_a}.
Different types of adsorbed oxygen species are observed during the dissociation of \ce{NO} by Rienks et al. \parencite*{Rienks2003} at \qty{527.7}{\eV} and \qty{529.7}{\eV}, the latter only shortly distant from \ce{NO_a} reported at \qty{529.8}{\eV}.
Kondratenko et al. \parencite*{Kondratenko2006} report \ce{O_a} and \ce{OH_a} at \qty{529.7}{\eV} and \qty{532}{\eV} respectively during the decomposition of \ce{N_2O} after exposition to \ce{H_2}, based on previous works by Wild et al. \parencite*{Wild2000}.

\label{tab:XPSPt100}
\end{table}

% argon

% high ox
The Pt(100) surface was exposed to \qty{8.8}{\milli\bar} of oxygen after argon.
The peaks at \qty{538.3}{\eV} and \qty{537.2}{\eV} can be attributed to \ce{O_{2,g}}.
As observed for Pt(111), the positions are shifted in energy with respect to literature \parencite{Avval2022}.
Oxide signals were measured after \qty{1}{\hour} under \qty{80}{\milli\bar} of oxygen with SXRD (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt100B}), but no stable surface of bulk oxide was observed at an oxygen pressure of \qty{5}{\milli\bar}.
Some transient peaks were measured but disappeared after a few hours of measurements (fig. \ref{fig:MapsPt100D}).
By comparing with the previously reported literature values, the large peak at \qty{529.7}{\eV} is attributed to adsorbed oxygen.
It is possible that the oxygen atoms linked to the transient surface structure yield some intensity around \qty{530.5}{\eV}, where a small region of higher intensity is observed.
No peak near \qty{527.7}{\eV} was observed throughout the experiment.

% ratio 8
Adding ammonia in the cell brings us to reacting conditions with \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} = \num{8}.
Interestingly, this does not remove the \ce{O_a} peak in the O 1s level, but introduces a gas phase water (\ce{H_2O_g}) peak at \qty{533.7}{\eV} \parencite{Weststrate2006, Linford2019}, probably generated by the oxidation reaction.
The \ce{O_a} peak has a lower intensity, which can be linked to the oxidation reaction utilising oxygen to produce water and nitric oxide.
A \qty{1}{\eV} wide peak at \qty{404.3}{\eV} is reported in the N 1s level, linked to \ce{NO_{g}} and possibly to \ce{N_{2, g}}.
\ce{NO_{g}} is expected between \qty{404.5}{\eV} and \qty{406.7}{\eV}, while \ce{N_{2,g}} between \qty{403.9}{\eV} and \qty{404.8}{\eV} \parencite{Ivashenko2021}, which could explain the broad peak shape.
% The fact that the partial pressure of \ce{NO} is higher than for Pt(111) tends to support this hypothesis.
Since gas phase peaks are shifting when changing the partial pressure of oxygen, it is difficult to be certain of the peak nature.
Most importantly, the presence of the peak at \qty{529.7}{\eV} shows that oxygen is adsorbed on Pt(100), even during reacting conditions, which was not as clear for Pt(111) (fig. \ref{fig:O1sN1sPt111}).
Novell-Leruth et al. \parencite*{NovellLeruth2008} have reported that the de-hydrogenation process of ammonia is favoured to occur \textit{via} \ce{O_a} rather than \ce{OH_a} on Pt(100) in comparison with Pt(111).
No peak could be linked to \ce{OH_a}, reported at \qty{532}{\eV} on Pt(100).
It is possible that a second peak exist near \qty{530.5}{\eV}, linked also to adsorbed oxygen as reported by Derry et al. \parencite*{Derry1984}, possibly on different sites.
This differs from the Pt(111) surface for which both \ce{O_a} and \ce{OH_a} could be clearly identified, and with similar intensity.
This difference in chemisorbed oxygen presence could explain the Pt(100) surface higher selectivity towards the production of \ce{NO}.
All the \ce{NH_x} species are probably quickly oxidised towards atomic nitrogen, which then reacts with a neighbouring oxygen to form \ce{NO_a}.
Adsorbed \ce{NO} at \qty{401.3}{\eV} was not observed during the dissociation of \ce{NO} on Pt(100) above room temperature by XPS \parencite{Rienks2003}.
\ce{NO} desorbs too quickly from the catalyst surface to be here detected, as reported by Ivashenko et al. \parencite*{Ivashenko2021}.

% ratio 05
Reducing the partial pressure of oxygen to obtain \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} = 0.5 induces a remarkable change in the O 1s spectrum, removing the \ce{O_a} peak, introducing a \ce{H_2O_a} peak at \qty{532.1}{\eV}, and shifting the \ce{H_2O_g} peak by \qty{0.6}{\eV}.
It is difficult to differ between \ce{OH_a} and \ce{H_2O_a}.
\ce{OH_a} is reported at \qty{532.0}{\eV}, but such a peak also exists under argon atmosphere, characteristic of water contamination in the reactor.
A binding energy of \qty{400.0}{\eV} in the N 1s spectrum is linked to adsorbed atomic nitrogen on Pt(100) \parencite{Sugai1993, vandenBroek1999}.
Since the only product of the ammonia oxidation is now nitrogen, the peak at \qty{404.3}{\eV} can safely be assigned to \ce{N_{2,g}}, similar to reported values \parencite{Ivashenko2021}.
Ammonia being in excess in the surface vicinity, all of the oxygen is used during ammonia oxidation yielding \ce{H_2O}, since \ce{NO} or \ce{N_2O} can not be detected.
This can be explained by the lack of available atomic oxygen adsorbed on the surface to form \ce{NO_a}, which is also the first step in the production of \ce{N2O}.
%, only observed without oxygen in the reactor.
% All of the oxygen is used in the first steps of the ammonia oxidation to remove hydrogen atoms from \ce{NH_x} species.
%, adsorbed hydrogen atoms then recombine and desorb from the surface.
%When \ce{OH_a} groups recombine to produce water, one oxygen atom is left on the catalyst surface.
\ce{H_2} is also produced from the dissociation of \ce{NH_3} on the catalyst.
It seems that in this condition, the oxygen atoms are preferably used for the de-hydrogenation process rather than the formation of \ce{NO} by reacting with adsorbed nitrogen.
The recombination of two nitrogen atoms on the catalyst surface is probably energetically preferred to the reaction of adsorbed nitrogen with adsorbed oxygen at low \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} ratios.
% At this condition, most of the surface sites are hypothesised to be occupied by adsorbed water or nitrogen.
\ce{NH_{3,g}} reported between \qty{400.4}{\eV} and \qty{400.7}{\eV} \parencite{Ivashenko2021} was not clearly detected.
Nevertheless, it is possible that it also gives a contribution to the peak at \qty{400.0}{\eV}.

% ammonia
The next condition is pure ammonia.
Removing oxygen from the reactor removes the gas phase water peak from the O 1s level, adsorbed water is still present but shifted in energy, with the same peak shape, maybe from a lower presence of \ce{OH_a} groups since no more oxygen is present.
The dissociation of ammonia towards \ce{N_2} and \ce{H_2} is measured with the mass spectrometer.
\ce{N_{2,g}} is measured, shifted by \qty{0.6}{\eV}.
The peak at \qty{400.6}{\eV} can tentatively be linked to a superposition of gas phase ammonia and adsorbed \ce{NH_{x,a}} species.
No \ce{N_a} peak can be observed which supports a slow dissociation process of ammonia of the Pt(100) surface.

% low o2
Removing ammonia and adding \qty{0.55}{\milli\bar} of oxygen in the reactor shows at least five peaks in the O 1s level.
Both peaks at \qty{538.3}{\eV} and \qty{537.2}{\eV} are from gas phase oxygen.
At least three different oxygen species are present on the catalyst.
The peak at \qty{529.7}{\eV} exhibits a high intensity and low width, attributed to the presence of chemisorbed oxygen on Pt(100).
At least two other peaks can be detected at higher energy, around \qty{530.6}{\eV} and \qty{531.4}{\eV}.
If only one peak was present at \qty{531.4}{\eV} the intensity would drop between at \qty{530.6}{\eV} which is not the case here.
\ce{OH_a} reported at \qty{532}{\eV} \parencite{Kondratenko2006} is too far from the energies indexed here to be linked to the peak at \qty{531.4}{\eV}.
Thus, various oxygen species, adsorbed on different sites (e.g. hollow, on-top, bridge) may be linked to the peaks at \qty{530.6}{\eV}, and \qty{531.4}{\eV}.
The peak at \qty{530.6}{\eV} may also correspond to the transient structure measured with SXRD under \qty{5}{\milli\bar} of oxygen, also measured near \qty{530.4}{\eV} with XPS under \qty{8.8}{\milli\bar} of oxygen partial pressure.
The oxygen specie at \qty{529.7}{\eV} is predominant compared to the other species.
% The ammonia oxidation may prevent the other species from existing due to the high mobility of adsorbed atoms on the catalyst surface.

\subsubsection{Pt 4f level}

The Pt 4f level was also measured, presented in fig. \ref{fig:Pt4fPt100}.
No bulk oxide could be detected during reacting conditions, or under the presence of \qty{5}{\milli\bar} of oxygen with SXRD.
However, many different surface structures were identified under reacting conditions, changing as a function of the \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} ratio (fig. \ref{fig:MapsAndLScansPt100HighOxAmmonia} - \ref{fig:MapsAndLScansPt100LowOxAmmonia}).

The introduction of \qty{8.8}{\milli\bar} of oxygen in the reactor induces a shift of \qty{0.1}{\eV} in the main peak position compared to pure argon atmosphere.
Two new features can be detected, at \qty{71.8}{\eV} and \qty{71.4}{\eV}, linked to the presence of oxygen atoms on top of the catalyst surface.
One new peak was clearly identified to appear in the O 1s level during this condition at \qty{529.7}{\eV} (fig. \ref{fig:O1sN1sPt100}), attributed to chemisorbed oxygen based on reported literature values \parencite{Rienks2003, Kondratenko2006}.
One of the two peaks at \qty{71.8}{\eV} and \qty{71.4}{\eV} is probably from the same specie.
The other may be linked to the moieties yielding peaks near \qty{530.5}{\eV} in the O 1s level.
% The presence of \ce{OH_a}, involved in the reaction mechanism but not measured in the O 1s level, is thus also rules out here.

The next condition is \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} = \num{8}.
The main peak is shifted towards lower binding energy, possibly from the appearance of a new peak linked to adsorbed water as discussed below.
Both peaks identified under oxygen do not disappear but have a decreased intensity, similarly to what has been observed in the O 1s level, as a result of the participation of oxygen species in the catalytic reaction.

Reducing the partial pressure of oxygen to \qty{0.55}{\milli\bar} so that \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} = \num{0.5} has the effect of removing the oxygen induced features at high binding energy.
The peak region near \qty{71.5}{\eV} closely resembles that observed under argon atmosphere.
The \ce{O_a} peaks in the O 1s level also disappeared during this condition.
Interestingly, the peak shape is broader and extended towards lower binding energy.
Adsorbed water is detected in the O 1s level at this condition.
\ce{H_2O_a} could not be detected in the O 1s level when \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} = 8.
However, it is not possible to rule out its presence due to the low intensity of the XPS spectrum.
Thus, the shift towards lower energy in the Pt 4f level may be due to adsorbed water for both reacting conditions, more important when \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} = 0.5.
The same reasoning can be applied to adsorbed nitrogen.

The following condition is pure ammonia atmosphere, the broadening effect at low binding energy is reverted.
Removing oxygen from the reactor removed the \ce{N_a} peak from the N 1s level, adsorbed water does not disappear.
However, the related energy position in the O 1s level is slightly shifted, from \qty{532.1}{\eV} to \qty{532.4}{\eV}, which underlines different chemical environments.
A new signal near \qty{71.6}{\eV} can safely be attributed to the presence of adsorbed \ce{NH_{x,a}} species, also identified in the N 1s level.
The peak intensity with respect to the maximum intensity is the highest measured, translating a large coverage of the platinum surface by \ce{NH_{x,a}}.

Changing the reactor atmosphere to \qty{0.55}{\milli\bar} of oxygen removes this \ce{NH_{x,a}} signal at \qty{71.6}{\eV}.
Overall the peak shape is similar to that under \qty{8.8}{\milli\bar} of oxygen.
The weaker intensity at higher binding energy is probably linked to a lower presence of the species measured under \qty{8.8}{\milli\bar} of oxygen.

Finally, reverting to argon atmosphere removed the peaks linked to \ce{O_a}.
However, the peak has not completely reverted to its shape before the oxidation cycle, and is very similar to the shape under a \ce{O_2}/\ce{NH_3} ratio equal to \num{0.5}.
The adsorbed nitrogen is absent from the Pt surface, only adsorbed water is present at both conditions, which was also present before the oxidation cycle but in a lower amount.
Therefore, adsorbed water is linked to the peak at lower binding energy, rather than \ce{N_a}.
