\textcolor{red}{This Chapter should demonstrate that you have conducted a thorough and critical investigation of relevant sources.
Apart from a presentation of the sources of your data, this chapter allows you to critically discuss the data (whatever these data are, ‘quantitative’ or ‘qualitative’, primary or secondary), which is proof of good research. You can even do good research with poor data but you must demonstrate that you are aware of the data quality and accordingly are careful in your interpretations. Essentially, there are three aspects to consider:
\begin{enumerate}
\item	Reliability, which, for example, could depend on whether they are estimates or more direct evidence;
\item	Representativity, which is about how typical the data are; for example, you may have arguments why the very few cases are typical or you may carry out statistical tests;
\item Validity, which is about the relevance of the data for your case. Strictly speaking, sometimes no valid data are available but one may argue that there are other data which could be used as ‘proxies’.)

Bimetallic nanomaterials have raised more and more significant interest from worldwide researchers in recent years, their new physical and chemical properties deriving from synergistic effects between the two metals being highly desirable for catalytic applications \cite{}.
For example, bimetallic catalysts consisting either of two noble metals (Pt-Rh, Au-Pd) or a noble and a 3d/4d transition metal (e.g. Pt-Cu) can show tremendously higher catalytic activities and altered selectivity in both conventional thermal and electrochemical catalysis \parencite{Resta2020a, Carnis2021b}.

In the case of the oxidation of ammonia, if Pt catalysts were first used when aiming at the production of \nitricoxide, Pt-Rh catalysts have then proven to be more effective since the 1920s when Rhodium was first added to the catalyst \parencite{Handforth1934, Heck1982}.
Recently, the ammonia oxidation reaction over a Pt-Rh binary alloy was studied with a surface science approach by operando techniques such as near-ambient pressure X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) and surface x-ray diffraction (SXRD) combined with mass spectrometry \parencite{Resta2020a}.
It was shown that \nitricoxide production coincides with significant changes of the surface structure and the formation of a \ce{RhO_2} surface oxide.
Moreover, changes in the surface relaxation related to the catalyst selectivity as well as the presence of an hysteresis cycle in the reaction were reported.

Recent studies have shown that nanoparticle surface strain can be controlled, opening up a new path to tune and optimise nanoparticle catalysts \parencite{Zhang2014, Sneed2015, Wang2016}.
However, these more conventional techniques traditionally provide ensemble-averaged properties when studying nanoparticles.
With Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI), we intend to address under \textit{in situ} and \textit{operando} conditions the individual three-dimensional (3D) structural response of an isolated nanoparticle to changes in gas mixtures, enabling us to probe more deeply the details of catalytic phenomena \parencite{Fernandez2019, Passos2020, Dupraz2022}.

In that frame of mind, we aim at investigating in situ the catalytic structure-activity relationships of Pt nanoparticles during the oxidation of ammonia, as a stepping stone to the study of Pt-Rh nanoparticles.
A careful in situ analysis of the properties of the nanoparticles (size, shape, strain, refaceting, support, interaction, oxide formation, etc) in 3D is of essential importance to gain more understanding of the behaviour of these nanocrystals during a catalytic reaction.

\section{Experimental setup}\label{sec:BCDISetup}

The BCDI experiment was performed at the SixS (Surface Interface X-ray Scattering) beamline of synchrotron SOLEIL, France (sec. \ref{sec:SIXS}).
As detailed in sec. \ref{sec:Gwaihir}, one of the bottlenecks of the BCDI technique is its slow data reduction and analysis process.
Moreover, on $3^{rd}$ generation synchrotrons that offer a lower coherent flux (eq. \ref{eq:CoherentFlux}) than $4^{th}$ generation synchrotrons, the measurement time can also be very long.
At SixS, a rocking curve lasts between \qtyrange{20}{90}{\min} depending on the particle size, the quality of the alignment, the strain of the particle, \textit{etc.}
Once the raw data is obtained, the particle must be \textit{reconstructed} (sec. \ref{sec:PhaseRetrieval}), and - if of interest - the displacement and strain arrays can be retrieved.
The analysis workflow can take up to an hour, which totals to an average of two hours from the start of the measurement to the moment when the user has a good idea of the sample shape and structure.

SixS is a beamline that does not only carry out BCDI experiment, but also SXRD experiments, in the same experimental end-station (sec. \ref{sec:MED}).
When aiming at performing \textit{operando} catalysis experiments, switching from one setup to another can take up to a few days.
This leaves only a limited remaining amount of time to align the sample, find a suitable nanoparticle, and carry out the experimental plan.

Li \textit{et al.} \parencite*{Li2020}, who have first shown that the SixS beamline could be used to carry out BCDI experiment, also started to work on improving the BCDI measurement process.
By comparing continuous and step-by-step measurements, they have shown that continous scanning would result in the same data quality while decreasing the measurement dead-time by \qty{30}{\percent}, thereby paving the way for quicker BCDI measurements.

During this thesis, the measurement process was further improved by taking advantage of the new possibility to perform continuous \textit{on-the-fly} scans at SixS, while moving the hexapod holding the sample.
When using the coherence setup (fig. \ref{fig:OpticalSetup}) in the vertical geometry (fig. \ref{fig:Diffractometer}), the beam is focused on the sample and is about \qty{1}{\um} large vertically, the horizontal footprint depending on the incident angle between the beam and the sample.
By satisfying Bragg's law in a specular geometry, the incoming angle is set to the Bragg angle $\theta$ (eq. \ref{eq:Bragglaw}).
The scattered x-rays are then collected by setting the out-of-plane detector angle $\gamma$ at a position $2\theta$ (similar to fig. \ref{fig:EwaldSphereSpecular}).
Finally, by simultaneously moving the sample with the hexapod and recording the Bragg scattered intensity with the detector, it is possible to map the sample surface with a sub-micron resolution (fig. \ref{fig:SampleMapping}).
A nanoparticle with a width equal to \qty{300}{\nm} was identified with this technique, which is a good estimate of the spatial resolution that can be attained, limited by the hexapod resolution (\qty{\approx 500}{\nm}) and the beam size.

Both in-plane angles are kept to zero, this is the simplest possible measurement geometry since the nanoparticles on the sample have their c-axis oriented along the [111] direction, parallel to the normal of the sample holder ($\vec{z}$ direction in the laboratory frame).

\begin{figure}[!htb]

    }
    \label{fig:SampleMapping}
\end{figure}

On the other hand, \textit{Gwaihir} (sec. \ref{sec:Gwaihir}) was developped primarily for the SixS beamline to counter the long analysis process, which allowed a significant reduction in the analysis time from around an hour to a few minutes.
The following beamtimes profit from the new software by having a more \textit{solution}-driven experimental process.
Indeed, to be measured, a nanoparticle must be isolated, not too small (weak scattered intensity), not too big (loss of coherence, fringes not visible), and not too initially strained (difficult to obtain a good guess of the support).
These conditions are sometimes difficult to assert by simply looking at the diffraction pattern.
Therefore, quick inversion using \textit{Gwaihir} allowed a faster decision process regarding the continuation or not of the nanoparticles measurement.

Successfull measurements by \cite{Lim2021} have permitted the simulatenous use of BCDI measurements from SixS with measurements from other imaging beamlines (ID01 - ESRF, P10 - DESY), designing a robust method to identify defects in the real space with convolutional neural networks (CNN).

In the frame of this thesis, the required beam size was obtained with a Fresnel zone-plate (focal distance of \qty{20}{\cm}), which focused the beam down to \qty{1}{\um} (horizontally) $\times$ \qty{2}{\um} (vertically).
A coherent portion of the beam was selected with high precision slits by matching their horizontal and vertical gaps with the transverse coherence lengths of the beamline: \qty{20}{\um} (horizontally) and \qty{100}{\um} (vertically).
\textcolor{Important}{check consistency}
A circular beam-stop, and a circular order-sorting aperture, were used to block the transmitted beam, and higher diffraction orders, respectively (fig. \ref{fig:OpticalSetup}).
The sample was mounted in the dedicated XCAT reactor with the substrate surface oriented in the vertical plane on a hexapod mounted vertically on the MED diffractometer (fig. \ref{fig:MEDV}).

The BCDI experiment was performed in a vertical specular geometry at a beam energy of \qty{8.5}{\keV} (wavelength of \qty{1.46}{\angstrom}).
Three-dimensional (3D) diffraction data were collected with rocking curves of the rotation angle around the normal of the sample, the diffracted beam was recorded with a 2D MAXIPIX photon-counting detector (\numproduct{515 x 515} square pixels, \qtyproduct{55 x 55}{\um} wide) positioned on the detector arm at a distance of \qty{1.22}{\meter}.
The in-plane ($\omega$) and out-of-plane ($\mu$) angles of the sample were \ang{0} and \ang{18.6}, respectively at \qty{25}{\degreeCelsius}, when the in-plane ($\delta$) and out-of-plane ($\gamma$) angles of the detector were \ang{0} and \ang{37.2}.
The value of the scattering angle $\mu$ ($\theta$ in eq. \ref{eq:Bragglaw}) and the out-of-plane detector angle ($2\theta$) are expected to vary as a function of the temperature during the experiment due to the thermal expansion of the sample.

\subsection{Synthetizing platinum nanoparticle}

The platinum nanoparticles were synthetized thanks to a collaboration with the Israel Institute of Technology (Technion) \parencite{Dupraz2017}.
A 30 nm thick homogeneous layer of platinum is deposited at room temperature on a (100) oriented alumina ($\alpha-$\ce{Al_2O_3}) substrate.
The Pt nanocrystals have their c-axis oriented along the [111] direction normal to the (0001) sapphire substrate.
A mask is then applied on the sample and a lithographic process route ensures that the platinum layer transform to nanoparticles that are between 100 and 1000 nm large,  epitaxied on the substrate surface.
After dewetting and heating at \qty{1100}{\degreeCelsius} for \qty{30}{\minute}, the platinum nanoparticles exhibit a well-faceted shape as seen in various BCDI measurements \parencite{Dupraz2017}. \textcolor{Important}{Add more ref with these samples}
The room temperature lattice parameter of platinum (\qty{3.924}{\angstrom}) is close to that of (100) alumina (\qty{4.122}{\angstrom}) resulting in \qty{\approx 5}{\percent} in-plane lattice strain.\textcolor{Important}{Check}
The mask yields isolated nanoparticles in the middle of \qty{100}{\um} large squares (fig. \ref{fig:Mask}).
The position of the squares is designated with arabic numbers (row), letters (column) and roman numbers (large rectangle).
The hole diameter in the mask changes in different rectangle and has a direct impact on the nanoparticle size since more matter is deposited.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{/home/david/Documents/PhD/Figures/sample/mask.png}

    \caption{
    	Mask applied during sample preparation (left) and resulting pattern on the sample surface (right).
    }
    \label{fig:Mask}
\end{figure}

All of the position indicators are constituted of platinum nanoparticle as well, which allows the scanning of the sample's surface in Bragg condition to map an area and find the nanoparticles' positions (fig. \ref{fig:SampleMapping}).

\subsection{Catalysis reactor calibration}

The catalytic activity of the platinum nanoparticles as a function of the temperature was studied to make certain that the nanoparticles were sufficently catalytically active for the reaction products to be detected by the mass spectrometer.
The catalytic activity of the reactor without any sample was also monitored and proven to be nul (sec. \ref{sec:SXRD100}), to make certain that no reaction occurs without the sample.

The heater temperature was first calibrated by measuring the temperature in the reactor at different atmospheres, as a function of the current intensity (fig. \ref{fig:TempRamps} - a).
The experimental data points were then fit using a polynomial of degree four to set the reactor to any temperature from \qtyrange{0}{600}{\degreeCelsius} (fig. \ref{fig:TempRamps} - b) when working under vacuum or at ambient pressure (\qty{0.3}{\bar} or \qty{0.5}{\bar} of \argon).
The thermal conductivity of the gases involved in the oxidation of ammonia is in the similar order of magnitude (tab. \ref{tab:ThermalConductivity}).
Moreover, the same gas - Argon - is used as a carrier gas during the experiments, constituting at least \qty{80}{\percent} of the gas flow, and allowing us to assume that the temperature in the reaction chamber is well approximated.

Two temperature ramps at a reactor pressure of \qty{0.3}{\bar} (fig. \ref{fig:TempRamps} - c, d) were carried out to probe the evolution of the reaction product as a function of the temperature under a constant gas flow (\qty{41}{\ml\per\min} of \argon, \qty{8}{\ml\per\min} of \dioxygen, \qty{1}{\ml\per\min} of \ammonia).
The excess of oxygen compared to ammonia is expected to favour the production of \nitricoxide at high temperatures (sec. \ref{sec:AmoOxiHC}).

    }
    \label{fig:TempRamps}
\end{figure}

The first temperature ramp to \qty{525}{\degreeCelsius} shows that the air present in the cell was not well extracted before reaching a temperature of \qty{300}{\degreeCelsius} \qty{14}{\min} after starting heating, the pressure of \nitrogen and \water continuously decreasing until then.
Above \qty{300}{\degreeCelsius}, the pressure of \nitrogen and \nitricoxide starts to increase, with a sligtly lower activation temperature for \nitrogen.
No production of \nitrousoxide can be detected during this temperature ramp.

A second temperature ramp was carried out to \qty{650}{\degreeCelsius} to see if the the activation temperature for the production of \nitrousoxide could be achieved.
The partial pressure of each reaction product is lower at the beginning of the temperature ramp which shows that the remaining air was well extracted.
The activation temperature for the production of \nitrogen can be more easily identified to be around \qty{300}{\degreeCelsius} and near \qty{450}{\degreeCelsius} for \nitricoxide, which is in accord with the data from the first temperature ramp.

However, the activation temperature for \nitrousoxide in the second temperature ramp is at about \qty{450}{\degreeCelsius}, a temperature that was reached during the first temperature ramp as well, but without the detection of \nitrousoxide.
This could be linked to either an activation process of the catalyst that lowers the activation temperature for the production of nitrous oxide, or more probably to a very low signal to noise ratio that hides the evolution of the partial pressure due to the remaining air in the reactor, the partial pressure on \nitrousoxide being the lowest of all the detected gases.

According to these primary results, the study of the oxidation of ammonia with BCDI was originally decided to be carried out at \qtylist{300;500;600}{\degreeCelsius}, temperatures before and after the catalyst light off (tab. \ref{tab:Conditions}).

To de-corellate the effect of temperature from the effect of the catalytic reaction on the nanoparticle structure, the alumina-supported nanoparticles were gradually heated from \qtyrange{25}{600}{\degreeCelsius} under a constant \argon-based gas flow (\qty{50}{\ml\per\min}) and at a pressure of \qty{0.3}{\bar}.

The same nanoparticle (so-forth called nanoparticle Amaterasu) was tracked during the heating process, rocking-curves around the [111] Bragg peak were measured every \qty{50}{\degreeCelsius} to probe its structural evolution, with \qty{201}{steps}, each counting for \qty{5}{\second}, resulting in an angular step equal to \ang{0.005}.
The measurement of a rocking curve took approximately \qty{22}{\minute}, with \qty{25}{\percent} of dead time.
The use of iterative algorithm for phase retrieval is detailed in tab. \ref{tab:ReconstructionProcess}.

The surface of the Pt nanoparticle coloured by the surface voxel strain values is presented in fig. \ref{fig:Amaterasu}, only 4 temperatures are shown because the shape and strain of the nanoparticle does not evolve between \qty{25}{\degreeCelsius} and \qty{400}{\degreeCelsius} besides the removal of the defect.
A dislocation identified at the interface with the substrate at \qty{25}{\degreeCelsius} from its strain signature and missing pipe of electronic density \parencite{Dupraz2015} was removed by an instrumental mistake which resulted in a flash heating procedure, the heater going from \qtyrange{150}{800}{\degreeCelsius} for a few minutes before coming back to \qty{150}{\degreeCelsius}.

The displacement field could not be perfectly unwrapped around the dislocation, resulting in two positive strain regions (in red) in the surrounding low strain region.

\subsection{Shape evolution}

The nanoparticle shape stayed roughly the same during the beginning of the temperature ramp and after the introduction of ammonia, the triangular [111] facet at the top of the particle can be recognized, with the same agency of the surrounding facets (fig. \ref{fig:Amaterasu} - [111] facet surrounded by six facets, [100], [010], [001], [1$\bar{1}$1], [11$\bar{1}$], [$\bar{1}$11]).
The bottom facet, in contact with the substrate, has a [$\bar{1}\bar{1}\bar{1}$] orientation.

% 25 -> 150, one more 113
The nanoparticle shape near the interface has become less round and more faceted from the disappearance of the defect, the surface strain between the interface and the particle has practically disappeared, while just one more [$\bar{1}\bar{1}3$] facet appeared on the side (fig. \ref{fig:AmaterasuFacetsEvolution} - a).
However, the total surface area occupied by the [$\bar{1}\bar{1}\bar{1}$], \{$\bar{1}10$\} and \{100\} facets has increased, the removal of the defect directly increasing the amount of voxels in the neighbouring facets (fig. \ref{fig:AmaterasuDefect}).

\begin{figure}[!htb]

    \label{fig:AmaterasuDefect}
\end{figure}

%150->450, loose all 113
If one expects a certain degree of symmetry from the equilibrium Winterbottom shape of a particle on a substrate \parencite{WINTERBOTTOM1967, Boukouvala2021}, this symmetry seems to only be reached at \qty{450}{\degreeCelsius} with three [$\bar{1}1\bar{1}$], [1$\bar{1}\bar{1}$] and [$\bar{1}\bar{1}$1] facets around the substrate for a total of 11 facets, which is also the only reconstruction without any \{113\} facets (fig. \ref{fig:AmaterasuFacetsEvolution}).
The surface occupied by the \{100\} facets was multipied by \qty{50}{\percent} between \qty{25}{\degreeCelsius} and \qty{450}{\degreeCelsius}, which is also the temperature at which most of the particle surface was recognized as faceted (fig. \ref{fig:AmaterasuFacetsEvolution}).

The facets around the bottom of the particle are the most subject to change during this temperature ramp while the facets at the top of particle are more stable (fig. \ref{fig:AmaterasuFacetsEvolution}).
Moreover, it is possible that due to the low imaging resolution of the experiment, it is impossible to distinguish the smallest facets present on the particle surface.
Indeed, fig. \ref{fig:AmaterasuFacetsEvolution} shows that the total surface area not recognized as facets from the algorithm is always near \qty{50}{\percent}.

    \label{fig:AmaterasuFacetsEvolution}
\end{figure}

% 450 -> 600, 110 and 113 appear
Interestingly, after the reshaping of the particle at \qty{450}{\degreeCelsius} that shows the disappearance of the \{113\} facets (fig. \ref{fig:AmaterasuFacetsEvolution}), the following rocking curves where impossible to reconstruct.
The disappearance of the \{113\} facets could have been the starting point of a thermally-induced mobility of the Pt atoms on the particle surface, only increasing with the temperature, and making it impossible for the algorithm to determine a fixed support for the reconstruction.

The introduction of \ammonia at \qty{600}{\degreeCelsius} seems to have stabilized the particle, which could again be succesfully reconstructed.
For the first time, a \{110\} facet appeared on the particle surface together with the return of a \{113\} facet, both seem to have formed at the junction of three [100], [$1\bar{1}1$] and [$\bar{1}1\bar{1}$] facets as seen in fig. \ref{fig:Amaterasu110}.
On the other side of the particle, a [$1\bar{1}1$] facet was replaced by a [$1\bar{1}0$] facet, without the appearance of a \{113\} facet.
The change is also visible in fig. \ref{fig:AmaterasuFacetsEvolution}, the relative surface occupied by the [111], [$\bar{1}\bar{1}\bar{1}$], \{110\} and \{113\} facets increasing, whereas the surface occupied by the \{$1\bar{1}1$\} and \{$\bar{1}1\bar{1}$\} decreases at \qty{600}{\degreeCelsius} under ammonia.

When introducing \dioxygen at \qty{600}{\degreeCelsius} to study the oxidation of ammonia, the nanoparticle was definitely lost during the measurement, not to be found again, which underlines the difficulty to study a highly exothermic reaction with BCDI.
Indeed, according to \cite{}, the reaction can heat the catalyst to very high temperatures which in our case could have been the trigger for the loss of the particle during the measurement, especially since the particle had so far resisted to the beam during the temperature ramp to \qty{600}{\degreeCelsius}.
From this first set of results, the measurement of Pt nanoparticles with BCDI was decided to be carried out at \qty{300}{\degreeCelsius} and \qty{450}{\degreeCelsius}.

\subsection{Strain evolution} \label{sec:StrainTempRamp}

\subsubsection{Determination of strain}

Lattice strain in diffraction is usually defined as the difference between the  reference and experimental lattice parameter values, respectively $a_{ref}$ and $a$ (eq. \ref{eq:StrainDiffraction}).

\begin{equation}
    \epsilon = \frac{a - a_{ref}}{a_{ref}}
    \label{eq:StrainDiffraction}
\end{equation}

The values of the lattice parameter can be extracted from the position $\vec{G}$ of the Bragg peaks in reciprocal space \textit{via} eq. \ref{eq:QandD3} and eq. \ref{eq:Interplanarspacing}.
However, the information extracted from the retrieved phase in BCDI is more complex since, by measuring three non-coplanar Bragg peaks, one may retrieve the full strain tensor (eq. \ref{eq:StrainTensor}) from the reconstructed displacement field $\vec{u}_{\hat{q_x}, \hat{q_y}, \hat{q_z}}$ (eq. \ref{eq:DisplacementField}), $\hat{q_x}, \hat{q_y}, \hat{q_z}$ being three orthogonal basis vector in the reciprocal space \parencite{Karpov2019}.

\begin{equation}
    \vec{u}_{\hat{q_x}, \hat{q_y}, \hat{q_z}} =
     \begin{pmatrix}
        \vec{u}_{\hat{q_x}} \\
        \vec{u}_{\hat{q_y}} \\
        \vec{u}_{\hat{q_z}} \\
     \end{pmatrix}
     \label{eq:DisplacementField}
\end{equation}

\begin{multicols}{3}
    \begin{equation}
        \epsilon =
        \begin{bmatrix}
            \epsilon_{xx} & \epsilon_{yx} & \epsilon_{zx}\\
            \epsilon_{xy} & \epsilon_{yy} & \epsilon_{zy}\\
            \epsilon_{xz} & \epsilon_{yz} & \epsilon_{zz}
        \end{bmatrix}
        \label{eq:StrainTensor}
    \end{equation}
    \break
    \begin{equation}
      \epsilon_{ij} = \frac{1}{2}
        \Bigg(
        \frac{\partial \vec{u}_{\hat{q_i}}}{\partial \hat{q_j}}
        +
        \frac{\partial \vec{u}_{\hat{q_j}}}{\partial \hat{q_i}}
        \Bigg)
        \label{eq:StrainTensorIJ}
    \end{equation}
    \break
    \begin{equation}
      \epsilon_{zz} =
        \Bigg(
        \frac{\partial \vec{u}_{\hat{q_z}}}{\partial \hat{q_z}}
        \Bigg)
        \label{eq:StrainTensorzz}
    \end{equation}
\end{multicols}

The idea behind using the strain tensor is to identify shear components in the displacement field, \textit{i.e.} see if components in one direction depend on other directions.
This can also help to identify defects present in nanoparticles \parencite{Lauraux2021}.
Using a single Bragg peak, we can only retrieve one component of the displacement field, obtained from the division of the retrieved phase $\Phi$ of the scattered x-rays by the value of the scattering vector at the center of mass of the 3D Bragg peak (\textit{i.e.} $\vec{q} = \vec{G}$), following the assumptions for phase retrieval detailed in sec. \ref{sec:StrainBCDI}, eq. \ref{eq:FcrystalBCDI3} - \ref{eq:FcrystalBCDI7}.

In our case, the direction of the [111] scattering vector is perpendicular to the sample, along the $\vec{z}$ axis of the laboratory frame.
Therefore, the [111] scattering vector, $\vec{G}_{111}$, is so forth described as $\vec{q}_z$, of magnitude  $|\vec{q}_z|$, with the direction described by the unit vector  $\hat{q_z}$, to be consistent with the equations detailed above.
Our approach to the strain is considerably simplified since we can only correctly derive one component of the strain tensor, $\epsilon_{zz}$ (eq. \ref{eq:StrainTensorzz}) as detailed below in eq. \ref{eq:StrainFromPhase1} - \ref{eq:StrainFromPhase3}.

\begin{align}
    \label{eq:StrainFromPhase1}
    & \Phi =  \vec{q}_z.\vec{u} \\
    \label{eq:StrainFromPhase2}
    & \frac{\Phi}{|\vec{q}_z|} = \frac{\vec{q}_z}{|\vec{q}_z|}.\vec{u} = \hat{q_z}.\vec{u} = \vec{u}_{\hat{q_z}} \\
    \label{eq:StrainFromPhase3}
    & \vec{\nabla} \vec{u}_{\hat{q_z}} = \frac{\partial u_{\hat{q_z}}}{\partial z} = \epsilon_{zz}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Homogeneous strain}

The deviation of the interplanar spacing from the room temperature value due to the thermal expansion of the crystal is expected to be homogeneous within the particle.
This isotropic \textit{homogeneous} strain ($\epsilon_{hmg}$) in the particle is removed by centering the Bragg peak before phase retrieval, otherwise resulting in a linear phase ramp \parencite{}.
It is of utmost important to study the evolution of the material first under an inert atmosphere to see if there is an evolution of the homogeneous strain not only due to the thermal expansion of the crystal, but also to global relaxation phenomena induced e.g. by the adsorption of molecules involved in the catalytic reaction.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

    \caption{
        The maximum value of the 3D Bragg peak is used to center the intensity before phase retrieval and to compute the average interplanar spacing $d_{111}$.

    \label{fig:MaxPeak}
\end{figure}

    }
    \label{fig:HomoStrain}
\end{figure}

The average interplanar spacing was computed from the scattering vector $\vec{q}_z$, \textit{via} eq. \ref{eq:QandD3} (fig. \ref{fig:HomoStrain}).
The interplanar spacing follows approximately a linear increase from \qty{2.2517}{\angstrom} at \qty{25}{\degreeCelsius} to \qty{2.2627}{\angstrom} at \qty{600}{\degreeCelsius} as a function of the temperature.
\textcolor{Important}{Errorbars}

Interestingly, there is no change of the average interplanar spacing after removal of the defect at \qty{150}{\degreeCelsius}.
There is however a very strong increase of the interplanar spacing at \qty{600}{\degreeCelsius}, which decreases after the introduction of ammonia.

\subsubsection{Heterogeneous strain}

The remaining strain after phase retrieval is called the \textit{heterogeneous} strain ($\epsilon_{htg}$) \parencite{GREDIAC1996, FAVIER2007, Atlan2023}, the total strain observed during this experiment being equal to $\epsilon_{tot} = \epsilon_{hmg} + \epsilon_{zz, htg}$

In BCDI, it is the displacement of small unit blocks making up the crystal lattice that is observed.
Depending on the instrumental parameters, these small unit blocks, called \textit{voxels}, have a more or less large size.
In this study, they are approximately \qtyproduct{10x10x10}{\nm} large.
The strain is thus not directly related to the deviation between the interreticular planes, but to the displacement field of these unit blocks from their equilibrium position.
The outermost layers of the crystal only constitute a low percentage of the surface voxels (\qty{\approx 11}{\percent} if we consider 5 atomic layers separated by the value of the interplanar spacing $d_{111}$), which lowers the contribution of the surface strain to the total strain contained in the surface voxels, reducing the ability to properly resolve e.g. surface relaxation effects.
The use of padding during the reconstruction algorithm decreases the voxel size, but without relying on the sampling of high-frequency components of the scattering amplitude and therefore does not increase the strain resolution.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{/home/david/Documents/PhDScripts/SixS\_2021\_01/FacetAnalyser/Angles.pdf}
    \caption{
        Angles between the $[111]$ direction (normal to the top facet and opposite to the bottom facet of the particle) and other crystallographic directions that describe the normals to the other facets of the particle.
    }
    \label{fig:Angles}
\end{figure}

The crystallographic orientation of a facet can be determined by computing the angle between the [111] direction and its normal, which is then related to a direction in real space (fig. \ref{fig:Angles}).
Facets with the same orientation (e.g. [100], [010], [001]) are grouped around the same value of the interplanar angle.
To be more precise, the angular value is computed as the average of the angle between the facet normal and the [111] direction plus the angle between the facet normal and the [$\bar{1}\bar{1}\bar{1}$] direction minus \ang{180}, \textit{i.e.} $(\angle (111, \vec{n}) + (\angle (\bar{1}\bar{1}\bar{1}, \vec{n}) -180))/2$.

If equivalent orientation translates into equal surface atomic structures (e.g. [111] and [$\bar{1}\bar{1}\bar{1}$]), the environment of equivalent facets is not always the same.
For example, it is important to differ between [1$\bar{1}$1] and [$\bar{1}$1$\bar{1}$] facets, the higher the value of the interplanar angle, the closer the facet is to the interface with the substrate, and thus the more its influence in prominent.
Moreover, if the [111] facet is at the top of the crystal and the furthest away from the substrate, the [$\bar{1}\bar{1}\bar{1}$] facet is expected to be fully in contact with the substrate.
Therefore, the mean value and standard deviation of the heterogeneous strain distribution on each facet is presented on fig. \ref{fig:AmaterasuStrain}, as a function of the angle between the facets normals and the [111] direction, to highlight this difference.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{/home/david/Documents/PhDScripts/SixS\_2021\_01/FacetAnalyser/FacetStrainEvolution.pdf}
    \caption{

    }
    \label{fig:AmaterasuStrain}
\end{figure}

% introduce in plane out of plane
It is important to realize that the displacement observed is \textit{only} in the [111] direction, which means that it translates deviations of the crystal structure perpendicular to the [111] and [$\bar{1}\bar{1}\bar{1}$] facets, but parallel to the [$\bar{1}$10] facets, themselves parallel to the [111] direction (fig. \ref{fig:Angles}).
For example, if there existed a displacement of the atoms on the \{100\} facets in the direction perpendicular to the [100] planes, its contribution to the displacement would not be visible.

Moreover, if the $\epsilon_{zz}$ component of the strain tensor on the [111] and [$\bar{1}\bar{1}\bar{1}$] facets is easily assimilated to variation of the interplanar spacing $d_{111}$ (positive strain is tensile strain, negative strain is compressive).
This physical meaning of the strain becomes more complex when observing facets that are neither parallel nor perpendicular to the [111] direction, such as the \{113\} or \{100\} facets.
For this reason, the following analysis of the heterogeneous strain is meant to be qualitative, a quantitative analysis could only be performed with the full strain tensor.
% The relation between in-plane and out-of-plane strain can be rationalized by the Poisson effect \parencite{Atlan2023}, which relates an in-plane tensile (compressive) strain to an out-of-plane compressive (tensile) strain (depending on the origin of the displacement field).

The values of the displacement are in general quite low (always less than \qty{0.2}{\percent}), which puts us far away from the BCDI limit discussed in sec. \ref{sec:StrainBCDI}.
Let's take the example of the particle at \qty{25}{\degreeCelsius} for which the absolute value of the heterogeneous strain is the highest.
We have $|\vec{G}| = \qty{}{\angstrom}$, the furthest value of the scattering vector probed during the measurement is $|\vec{q}| = \qty{}{\angstrom}$ which gives $(\vec{q}-\vec{G}).\vec{u}_k<<1$.

% Decribe removal of defect strain evolution 25°C -> 150 °C
The very large standard deviations seen in fig. \ref{fig:AmaterasuStrain} at \qty{25}{\degreeCelsius} for the [$\bar{1}\bar{1}\bar{1}$], [$\bar{1}1\bar{1}$], [$1\bar{1}1$] and [$11\bar{3}$] facets can be explained by the presence of the defect, around which the phase was not well unwrapped as seen in fig. \ref{fig:AmaterasuDefect}.
At \qty{150}{\degreeCelsius}, after removal of the defect, all of the facets show low strain values as well as low standard deviation.

% 150 -> 450
The strain values are still relatively low at \qty{450}{\degreeCelsius} but when comparing to the measurement at \qty{150}{\degreeCelsius}, we can see in fig. \ref{fig:Amaterasu} that the extremities of the [$\bar{1}\bar{1}\bar{1}$] facet are in tension, whereas the center is in compression.
The opposite effect seems to take place around the [111] facet, visible both in fig \ref{fig:Amaterasu} and \ref{fig:AmaterasuStrain}.
\textcolor{Important}{Why ?}

After the introduction of ammonia at \qty{600}{\degreeCelsius}, the particle could be reconstructed again.

\end{figure}

The alternating highly positive and negative strain regions in the middle of the [$\bar{1}\bar{1}\bar{1}$] facet (fig. \ref{fig:Amaterasu}) is the signature of a dislocation network forming in the interface with the substrate \parencite{Dupraz2015}, also responsible for the high strain standard deviation of this facet (fig. \ref{fig:AmaterasuStrain}).
A higher resolution in a 3D displacement field together with simulations of the impact of defect at the interface are needed to fully characterized this network, which is outside the scope of this thesis.

% 111 different effect
% other facets all same
% dif in env of 113 and 111 ?

In comparison with the measurement at \qty{450}{\degreeCelsius} under Argon, the [111] facet goes into compression (negative strain) as seen on fig. \ref{fig:Amaterasu}, \ref{fig:AmaterasuStrain} and \ref{fig:AmaterasuStrain1675}.
Moreover, we can see that the same effect takes place on the neighbouring \{100\} facets, none of which have the same environment (fig. \ref{fig:AmaterasuStrain1675}), while the edges and corners around the [111] and \{100\} facet show a positive strain.
Both [$0\bar{1}1$] and [$01\bar{1}$] facets have a very low strain.

At first sight, all facets that have a similar orientation show a similar strain (e.g. \{1-10\}, \{100\}).
However, the two \{111\} facets that are close to the substrate do not show the same strain than the three \{111\} facets closer to the top of the particle.
The strain being in the [111] direction with the origin of the displacement field in the center of the particle, if all of these facet had experienced the same compressive (tensile) strain perpendicular to their surface \textit{via} the adsorption of ammonia, they would all show a negative (positive) strain (of lower amplitude due to the angle between these facets and the [111] direction).

This behaviour could be linked to a strong effect of the support which has the dual effect of first preventing the [$\bar{1}\bar{1}\bar{1}$] facet from being exposed and secondly forcing them to accomodate the strain linked to the substrate.
There are three possibilities, first ammonia is effectively adsorbed on these facets but the influence of the substrate hides a possible common signature in the strain.
Secondly ammonia is not adsorbed and the strain difference is due to the influence of the substrate on the particle structure.
Thirdly, ammonia is adsorbed but only on the three top facets or only on the 2 bottom facets due to the influence of the substrate that either limitates or facilitates the adsorption process.

% Globally, the top of the particle seems to be in compression along $\vec{z}$ (fig. \ref{fig:Amaterasu}, \ref{fig:AmaterasuStrainSlices}), whereas the bottom of the particle is in tension, with the exception of the one [$1\bar{1}3$] facet (fig. \ref{fig:AmaterasuStrainSlices}) which is in compression.

% \end{figure}

Overall, it is difficult to conclude on any potential effect of the absorption of ammonia on the particle due to the presence of the dislocation network at the interface, to the lack of comparative reconstruction at \qty{600}{\degreeCelsius} under argon, and more importantly to the fact that we only possess one component of the strain tensor, making it difficult to quantify any relaxation effect on the facets that are not perpendicular to the [111] direction.

% The shape of the particle in the ($\vec{x}, \vec{y}$) plane at \qty{600}{\degreeCelsius} can be roughly approximated as a hexagon with 3 sides occupied by the [$\bar{1}11$], [$1\bar{1}1$] and [$11\bar{1}$] facets.
% The three other sides are occupied by the [100], [010], [001] facets near the top of the particle, under which are situated either 1) one large [$\bar{1}10$] facet, 2) one small [$1\bar{1}0$] facet under which in turn are two smalls [113] and [$\bar{1}1\bar{1}$] facets, 3) a large [$1\bar{1}\bar{1}$] facet.

%%
% The negative strain of the [$1\bar{1}1$] facets and the positive strain on the [$\bar{1}1\bar{1}$] facets (fig. \ref{fig:AmaterasuFacetsEvolution}) follows the respective evolution of the [111] and [$\bar{1}\bar{1}\bar{1}$] facets with a lower amplitude.
% An increase of the negative strain can also be seen on all three [100] facets but, based on the angle between those facets and the [111] direction (\ang{54.7}), the interpretation of this value is difficult to understand.
