# TODO
* (h, K) or [H, K]
* problem in thickness between reflectivity and l scans Pt(111)
* recheck literature for pt 100 oxide
* better discuss Pt100 oxide fitting assumptions
* better mention spoked wheel pt 111
* seriani reshaping nanoparticles
* do figure pt3o4 on pt(100)
* Emphasize in situ and operando
* Emphasize Pt oxides
* Check heating nanoparticle, mention lattice parameter evolution
* Mention cross correlation for defect
* Mention bragg ptychography
* Limits of TEM,
* particle reduction beforehand
* interfacial crack
* interfacial defect phase shift of pi
* which are the most favourable facets !!!
* no we, us
* in plane lattice displacement ROD fitting
* space groups P̅3m1 for alpha pto2 ? nomiyama2011
* what do we not see ?? xps, bcdi, sxrd

# Open questions
* Check if line profiles are really biased from ER
* BCDI -> real world
* beam stability: 1h30
* Fit L scans with distorted PtO2
* material loss on B7 nanoparticle ?

Stress expresses the internal forces that neighbouring particles of a continuous material exert on each other, while strain is the measure of the relative deformation of the material.

# Conditions
Only ratio for nanoparticle, partial pressures for single crystals

# RGA
Raw data:
* SXRD, Pt111, 450°C: Plots OK, CEM NOT OK, PTOT = 0.5 bar
* SXRD, Pt100, 450°C: Plots OK, CEM OK, PTOT = 0.5 bar
* SXRD, Nanoparticles, 300°C, 500°C, 600°C: Plots OK, CEM OK, PTOT = 0.3 bar
* BCDI, Nanoparticles, 300°C, 400°C: Plots OK, CEM OK, PTOT = 0.3 bar
* XPS, Pt111, Pt100, 450°C: OK

Compare between single crystals
* XPS, lower pressure, in mbar range: OK
* SXRD, OK
