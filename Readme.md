# TODO
* GenX and ROD parts in methods
* CTR surf signal with different layers in theory and methods
* Fit l scans with distorted PtO2 later
* what about the peak at high q that appears before hex structure in pt 111
* Use L-scans,
* Correct facet naming
* which are the most favourable facets
* phase diagram pt oxides
* energy of exp
* add x y z frame somewhere
Detail all kind of measurements performed on the single crystals (and nanoparticles) and why
