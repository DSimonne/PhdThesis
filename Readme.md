# TODO
## SXRD single crystals
* in plane lattice displacement ROD fitting
* pt100 hex reconstruction literature, and subsurface oxygen
* better discuss oxides ?

## SXRD nanoparticles
* Compare shape with wulff construction and other measurements
* Get particle average size from epitaxy
* Quantify amount of powder -> well epitaxied particles
* Double -110 facet, twin boundaries maybe ?

## BCDI
* Limits of TEM: electron as a probe so not great
* Which are the most favourable facets !!!
* Add facets on top and bottom of the particle in the image
* Change FWHM evolution to percentages
* Radial distributions analysis, onion rings !
* Cross correlation for defect
* Ask andrea about H decrease, NH3 ? or dissociation ?

## XPS
The peak at 531 ev for Pt111 is not oxide bc the PtO2 peak is not visible in the Pt4f level,
oxide reported at 531 ev on pt111 at 1 bar by Boden et al (2022)
also no 8x8 oxide detected so far in sxrd
* really no n signal or because it is used directly, that's what resta2020 says

## Intro
* Field / amplitude / intensity consistent ? seems ok
* summary ?
* $r_0$ use consistent ? $2\pi$ ? seems ok
* hypothesis to explain: dipole approximation, perfect crystals
* extinction length
