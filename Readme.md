# TODO
* Emphasize in situ and operando
* Emphasize Pt oxides
* Check if line profiles are really biased from ER
* Mention cross correlation for defect
* Describe how to choose the best solution
* Resolution in bcdi, fit ?
* mention gwaihir
* Mention bragg ptychography
* Limits of TEM,
* BCDI -> real world
* particle reduction beforehand
* interfacial crack
* beam induced damage: we have two nanoparticles
* beam stability: 1h30
* material loss on B7 nanoparticle ?
* interfacial defect phase shift of pi
* Fit L scans with distorted PtO2 later
* which are the most favourable facets !!!
* add x y z frame somewhere
* Detail all kind of measurements performed on the single crystals (and nanoparticles) and why
* add a, b, c etc to maps, doable in pdf
* no we, us
* in plane lattice displacement ROD fitting
* Why not one bulk and all different surface interfere at one q ?
* space groups P̅3m1 for alpha pto2 ?

Stress expresses the internal forces that neighbouring particles of a continuous material exert on each other, while strain is the measure of the relative deformation of the material.

# Conditions
Only ratio for nanoparticle, partial pressures for single crystals

# RGA
Raw data:
* SXRD, Pt111, 450°C: Plots OK, CEM NOT OK, PTOT = 0.5 bar
* SXRD, Pt100, 450°C: Plots OK, CEM OK, PTOT = 0.5 bar
* SXRD, Nanoparticles, 300°C, 500°C, 600°C: Plots OK, CEM OK, PTOT = 0.3 bar
* BCDI, Nanoparticles, 300°C, 400°C: Plots OK, CEM OK, PTOT = 0.3 bar
* XPS, Pt111, Pt100, 450°C: OK

Compare between single crystals
* XPS, lower pressure, in mbar range: OK
* SXRD, OK
