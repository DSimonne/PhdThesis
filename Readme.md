# TODO
* GenX and ROD parts in methods
* Fit l scans with distorted PtO2 later
* Use L-scans, not l
* which are the most favourable facets !!!
* add x y z frame somewhere
* Detail all kind of measurements performed on the single crystals (and nanoparticles) and why
* literature pt3o4 (seems ok not much), pt100 reconstructions and xps peaks
* what does the c mean ? in reconstruction
* correct hkl position naming
* consistency in maps, l scans caption
* add a, b, c etc to maps
* ask alina why some peaks are missing for pt3o4
* structure factor not intensity for CTR !
* all conditions in partial pressures
* check beam size consistency
* figure caption not analysis but description
* compute resolution for bcdi
* no we, us

* Need to say bcdi is used for defects or for heterogeneous catalysis for now, for example when speaking of facets

Stress expresses the internal forces that neighbouring particles of a continuous material exert on each other, while strain is the measure of the relative deformation of the material.
