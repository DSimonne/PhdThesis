# TODO
* Fit L scans with distorted PtO2 later
* which are the most favourable facets !!!
* add x y z frame somewhere
* Detail all kind of measurements performed on the single crystals (and nanoparticles) and why
* add a, b, c etc to maps, doable in pdf
* all conditions in partial pressures
* check beam size consistency
* no we, us

* Need to say bcdi is used for defects or for heterogeneous catalysis for now, for example when speaking of facets

Stress expresses the internal forces that neighbouring particles of a continuous material exert on each other, while strain is the measure of the relative deformation of the material.

# RGA
Raw data:
* SXRD, Pt111, 450°C: Plots OK, CEM NOT OK, PTOT = 0.5 bar
* SXRD, Pt100, 450°C: Plots OK, CEM OK, PTOT = 0.5 bar
* SXRD, Nanoparticles, 300°C, 500°C, 600°C: Plots OK, CEM OK, PTOT = 0.3 bar
* BCDI, Nanoparticles, 300°C, 400°C: Plots OK, CEM OK, PTOT = 0.3 bar
* XPS, Pt111, Pt100, 450°C

Compare between single crystals
* XPS, lower pressure, in mbar range:
* SXRD, OK
