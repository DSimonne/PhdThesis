abstract = {The ammonia oxidation reaction on supported polycrystalline platinum catalyst was investigated in an aluminum-based microreactor. An extensive set of reactions was included in the chemical reactor modeling to facilitate the construction of a kinetic model capable of satisfactory predictions for a wide range of conditions (NH3 partial pressure, 0.01-0.12atm; O2 partial pressure, 0.10-0.88atm; temperature, 523-673K; contact time, 0.3-0.7ms). The elementary surface reactions used in developing the mechanism were chosen based on the literature data concerning ammonia oxidation on a Pt catalyst. Parameter estimates for the kinetic model were obtained using multi-response least squares regression analysis using the isothermal plug-flow reactor approximation. To evaluate the model, the behavior of a microstructured reactor was simulated by means of a complete Navier-Stokes model accounting for the reactions on the catalyst surface and the effect of temperature on the physico-chemical properties of the reacting mixture. In this way, the effect of the catalytic wall temperature non-uniformity and the effect of a boundary layer on the ammonia conversion and selectivity were examined. After further optimization of appropriate kinetic parameters, the calculated selectivities and product yields agree very well with the values actually measured in the microreactor. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations explored the reaction pathways on Pt(111) and Pt(211). It was shown, both in theory and experimentally, that ammonia is activated by adsorbed oxygen, i.e. by Oad or by OHad. In situ XPS up to 1 mbar showed the existence of NHx (x = 0,1,2,3) intermediates on Pt(533). Based on a mechanism of ammonia activation via the interaction with Oad/OHad a detailed and a simplified mathematical model were formulated which reproduced the experimental data semiquantitatively. From transient experiments in vacuum performed in a transient analysis of products (TAP) reactor it was concluded that N2O is formed by recombination of two NOad species and by a reaction between NOad and NHx,ad (x = 0,1,2) fragments. Reaction-induced morphological changes were studied with polycrystalline Pt in the mbar range and with stepped Pt single crystals as model systems in the range 10-5-10-1 mbar. {\textcopyright} the Owner Societies.},

Using an oxygen atom beam, we generated atomic oxygen coverages as high as 3.6 ML (monolayers) on Pt(1 0 0) in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV), almost 6 times the maximum coverage obtainable by dissociatively adsorbing O2. The results show that oxidation occurs through the development of several chemisorbed phases prior to oxide growth above about 1 ML. A weakly bound oxygen state that populates as the coverage increases from approximately 0.50 ML to 1 ML appears to serve as a necessary precursor to Pt oxide growth. We find that increasing the coverage above about 1 ML causes Pt oxide particle growth and significant surface disordering. Decomposition of the Pt oxide particles produces explosive O2 desorption characterized by a shift of the primary TPD feature to higher temperatures and a dramatic increase in the maximum desorption rate with increasing coverage. Based on thermodynamic considerations, we show that the thermal stability of the surface Pt oxide on Pt single crystal surfaces significantly exceeds that of bulk PtO2. Furthermore, we attribute the high stability and the acceleratory decomposition rates of the surface oxide to large kinetic barriers that must be overcome during oxide formation and decomposition. Lastly, we present evidence that structurally similar oxides develop on both Pt(1 1 1) and Pt(1 0 0), therefore concluding that the properties of the surface Pt oxide are largely insensitive to the initial structure of the Pt single crystal surface. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Annealing at 920 °C stimulates a continuous rotation of the hex where all angles between ±0.7° are simultaneously realized. At temperatures around 1080 °C, the nonrotated hex coexists with a hex that is rotated by about 0.75°. Annealing at temperatures around 1120 °C yield a locking of the hex in fixed rotation angles of 0.77°, 0.88°, and 0.94°.

abstract = {Density functional theory simulations were used to study the mechanism of ammonia oxidation over Pt(100). The conversion of NH3 leading to NHx intermediates upon reaction with adsorbed oxygen-containing species and ultimately forming reaction products (NO, N2O, N 2, and H2O), have been systematically computed. The reaction proceeds via an imide mechanism, while classical mechanisms postulating nitroxyl and hydroxylamine as reaction intermediates may be excluded. The barriers of oxidative NH3 dehydrogenation over Pt(100) are drastically decreased with respect to the nonoxidative dehydrogenation, particularly when the number of hydrogen atoms in the NHx fragment is decreased. Ammonia activation and subsequent NHx dehydrogenation steps are greatly favored by Oads with respect to OHads on Pt(100). This differs from calculations on Pt(111) due to the metal sharing effect and to the lower stability of adsorbed hydroxyl in the latter facet. Nitrogencontaining products are formed by recombination of chemisorbed N with N (N2), O (NO), and NO (N2O). Water is formed via recombination of adsorbed OH, regenerating an active O. The O-mediated abstraction of the first proton of NH3 is the slowest dehydrogenation step, whereas NO desorption determines the rate of the overall process. Rate coefficients of the elementary steps involved in the mechanism have been calculated, enabling a microkinetic analysis of the reaction. Our simplified model predicts reasonably well the product distribution obtained experimentally at different temperature, time, and NH3/O2 ratio. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

The hexagonal first layer superstructure of this surface, written in matrix notation as N 1 -1 5, N = 12-14, was imaged with atomic resolution. The fivefold periodicity of this reconstruction was confirmed. The coexistence of differently oriented hexagonal domains on a single terrace was observed. Steps along the longer corrugation length of the surface reconstruction were found, on the average, to follow the [N 1] direction of the hexagonal Pt overlayer rather than any low-index direction of the square substrate. The transition from the N 1 -1 5 reconstruction to the Pt(100)-(1 × 1) surface structure due to exposure to CO and O2 was found to be initiated by heterogeneous nucleation, the nucleation centers being step edges and structural irregularities disrupting the hexagonal structure along a direction close to the hexagonal [1̄ 5] direction. The growth of the (1 × 1) phase was highly anisotropic, i.e. the growth being much faster along the [01̄1] direction (the substrate direction closer to the [N 1] direction of the hexagonal layer) than along the [011] direction. A higher density of atoms in the hexagonal than in the (1 × 1) surface layer causes islands, a single Pt(100) lattice spacing high, to form during the structural transformation. These islands were found to be a mixture of isotropic islands with diameter 10-15 {\AA} and islands highly elongated along the faster growth direction of the (1 × 1) phase. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {Deactivation of 2.0-15 nm Pt crystallites supported on alumina and Pt black was studied in a fixed-bed differential reactor during NH3 oxidation by molecular oxygen between 368 and 473 °K. Marked deactivation caused by surface oxidation took place during the first 12 hr on stream. Deactivation occurred only in the presence of both reactants. It was more severe with smaller crystallites and at lower temperatures. The rate decay was best described by a second-order deactivation process. At 433 °K oxygen present in the deactivated 2.7 nm crystallites was about 5 atoms per surface Pt atom, giving an estimated bulk composition of PtO1.7. For the 15.5 nm crystallites the oxygen present in the deactivated crystallites was about 7 atoms per surface Pt atom but the resultant bulk composition was PtO0.5. Deactivation was reversible and activity could be restored by raising the temperature above 473 °K or by reacting with H2 or NH3. Deactivated catalyst slowly released oxygen in reaction with NH3 chemisorbed on the support after the feed O2 and NH3 were turned off. This is a form of reverse spillover. Platinum black studies confirmed the results with the supported catalysts. {\textcopyright} 1976.},

In addition, the amorphous structures of many surface oxides have hindered realistic theoretical studies.

abstract = {We investigated the kinetics governing the transition from surface (2D) to bulk (3D) oxide growth on Pt(1 0 0) in ultrahigh vacuum as a function of the surface temperature and the incident flux of an oxygen atom beam. For the incident fluxes examined, the bulk oxide formation rate increases linearly with incident flux ($\Phi$O) as the oxygen coverage increases to about 1.7 ML (monolayer) and depends only weakly on the surface temperature in the limit of low surface temperature (TS < 475 K). In contrast, in the high temperature limit (TS > 525 K), the bulk oxide formation rate increases with $\Phi$O2 for oxygen coverages as high as 1.6 ML, and decreases with increasing surface temperature. We show that the measured kinetics is quantitatively reproduced by a model which assumes that O atoms adsorb on top of the 2D oxide, and that this species acts as a precursor that can either associatively desorb or react with the 2D oxide to form a 3D oxide particle. According to the model, the observed change in the flux and surface temperature dependence of the oxidation rate is due to a change in the rate-controlling steps for bulk oxide formation from reaction at low temperature to precursor desorption at high temperature. From analysis of flux-dependent uptake data, we estimate that the formation rate of a bulk oxide nucleus has a fourth-order dependence on the precursor coverage, which implies a critical configuration for oxide nucleus formation requiring four precursor O atoms. Considering the similarities in the development of surface oxides on various transition metals, the precursor-mediated transition to bulk oxide growth reported here may be a general feature in the oxidation of late transition metal surfaces. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to compare the dissociation of NHx (x = 1-3) species on the Pt{100}, Pt{111}, and Pt{211} surface. Pt{211} is a stepped surface, and Pt{100} consists of square arranged surface atoms. Both surfaces are less compact than Pt{111}. The question is addressed whether the Pt{100} and the Pt{211} surface promote the dissociation of NHx species by lowering the activation barriers with respect to Pt{111}. The NH dissociation reaction is promoted on Pt{100} but not on Pt{211}. The NH2 dissociation reaction is neither promoted by Pt{100} nor Pt{211}. The dissociation of NH3 is also not promoted and turns out to be a two-step reaction on the platinum surfaces. Atop-bonded NH2 is intermediate and equally stable on the three surfaces. The nature of the transition states, which is late in the formation and early in the rearrangement of this atop-bonded NH2, makes the barriers almost independent of the surface topology. Because the reaction energies of the NHx dissociation reactions do depend on the surface topology the findings are unexpected, but they are consistent with an experimentally found moderate structure sensitivity of the ammonia decomposition on platinum. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The development of improved Ammonia Slip Catalysts (ASCs) was pursued by changing the composition and architecture of the critical functions, Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) and oxidation, needed in the catalyst for high NH 3 oxidation activity and selectivity to N2. Selected space velocities and reactant compositions were used to probe chemical and physical processes that limit the performance of ASCs. On a single component Pt/Al 2O3 catalyst, at the lower space velocity (66k h -1) light-off was characterized by a sharp increase in NH3 conversion to >98\%, while at high space velocity (265k h-1) the transition in conversion was more gradual and the limiting conversion was below 98\%, indicative of transverse transport limitations. The light-off temperature of ammonia oxidation on Pt/Al2O3 catalyst decreased with Pt loading from 0.7 to 10 g Pt/ft3 monolith and, in general, the selectivity to N2 decreased while that of N2O and NO x increased. A dual-layer ASC comprising a top layer of Fe-ZSM-5 and a bottom layer of Pt/Al2O3 resulted in higher selectivity and yield to N2, due to SCR reactions between the counter diffusing NOx formed in the Pt/Al2O3 and NH3 reactant in the Fe-zeolite layer. However, the diffusion resistance provided by the Fe-ZSM-5 layer inhibited the overall ammonia conversion at high space velocity. When Fe-zeolite and Pt/Al2O3 particles were mixed and washcoated as a single layer, this led to an increase in NH 3 conversion at high space velocity due to a decrease in the diffusion barrier that was observed with the dual-layer structure. When SCR and oxidation catalyst particles were contiguous in the washcoat structure as in single-layer mixed catalysts, the N2 yield was lower due to Pt-catalyzed NH3 oxidation, compared to the dual-layer ASC, which was especially apparent at low space velocity. The dual-layer catalyst was superior to the mixed layer catalyst at high temperatures, exhibiting lower NO x and higher N2 yields whereas the mixed catalyst out-performed the dual-layer catalyst at low temperature by exhibiting lower N2O and higher N2 yield. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

They are constructed from expanded oxide rows with a lattice constant close to that of $\alpha$-PtO2, either assembling into spoked wheels, 1-5 bar O2, or closely packed in parallel lines, above 2.2 bar. Both are only ordered at elevated temperatures (400-500 K). The triangular oxide can also form on the square lattice of Pt(100). Under NO and CO oxidation conditions, similar features are observed.

abstract = {To understand the "pressure and material gap" in the platinum-catalyzed ammonia oxidation over Pt, the reaction was studied over a wide range of pressures (10-3-105 Pa) and temperatures (293-1073 K) with different Pt catalysts: stepped Pt(533) single crystal, knitted Pt gauze, and Pt foil. Experiments were supplemented by theory applying DFT calculations. It was concluded that the primary reaction step of NH3 oxidation, stripping of hydrogen from the NH3 molecule, is favored by the presence of surface O and OH species. The latter species are more active for dehydrogenation of NH2 and NH fragments. NO and N2 are the only nitrogen-containing products detected under UHV conditions (p<10-1 Pa). N2O was observed, however, at about 6 Pa (peak pressure) in the temporal analysis of products (TAP) reactor and under ambient pressure conditions of 100 kPa in a microstructured reactor. The pressure dependence of N2O formation is suggested to be related to a minimum surface coverage by reaction intermediates required for N2O formation, which is a real "pressure gap" phenomenon. Independently of the pressure range (10-3-105 Pa) and the type of Pt specimen, N2 formation prevails at low temperatures (<700 K), whereas NO production increases with temperature and becomes the dominant reaction channel at high temperature. Catalyst characterization by SEM revealed a reconstruction of the Pt surface after ammonia oxidation at ambient pressure. The degree of surface restructuring is related to the total exposure of the catalyst to the reactants. Surface roughening contributes to activation of the catalyst and changes in its selectivity. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We find that surface tension of the clusters induces a compression, which weakens the bonding of adsorbates compared with the bonding on extended surfaces. The effect is largest for close-packed surfaces and almost nonexistent on the more reactive steps and edges. The effect is largest at low coverage and decreases, even changing sign, at higher coverages where the strain changes from compressive to tensile. Quantum size effects also influence adsorption energies but only below a critical size of 1.5 nm for platinum and 2.5 nm for gold. We develop a model to describe the strain-induced size effects on adsorption energies, which is able to describe the influence of surface structure, adsorbate, metal, and coverage.},

abstract = {The mechanism and kinetics of NH 3 decomposition reaction mechanism has been a subject of interest for decades, although it is attracting renewed interest in connection with hydrogen generation for fuel cells. This system represents an example of a most peculiar nonlinear catalytic reaction sequence for which, even though the mechanistic steps are well-accepted and their DFT energetics widely studied, the microkinetics have not yet been fully investigated. In fact, there is no agreement even as to which step(s) are rate-limiting. Employing our Reaction Route (RR) Graph approach and the corresponding electrical analogy, we investigate in detail the steady-state microkinetics of the seven-step NH 3 decomposition reaction mechanism. Based on an Ohm's law representation of kinetics, we develop an accurate quasi steady-state (QSS) rate expression for the complete sequence, not possible with the usual QSS approach, which provides only numerical results for the nonlinear sequence. Further, it allows the rate-limiting step(s) to be identified in a rigorous manner, based simply on a comparison of the step resistances. Combining this with identification of the most abundant reactive intermediate (MARI), the mechanism and the rate expressions are pruned to provide a simplified rate law that is found to be in complete agreement with numerical QSS analysis as well as with our experimental data on Fe without any fitted parameters. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The structure transition Pt(100) 1 × 1 → hex is observed by means of LEED intensities. The clean metastable 1 × 1 phase is prepared by intermediate NO adsorption. The transition to the hexagonal surface structure, which is an activated process, is initiated by raising the temperature. Integral intensities for both integer order spots as well as for superstructure spots are taken as function of time for constant elevated temperatures and as function of temperature for continuous temperature increase. The development of spot profiles is recorded as well. It turns out that the spot half width of integer order spots remains constant during the transition. Intermediate stages during the structure change show considerable background which is concentrated to streaks and indicates structural disorder. The superstructure spots grow up from the streaks giving first a 1 × 5 pattern from which the final structure results by spot splitting in the very last stage of the transition. Their intensity increase is delayed with respect to the decrease of integer order spots. They occur already with a comparably narrow half width, which remains constant in a first part of the transition. In the second part, especially during the final splitting, a further reduction is observed. The results are qualitatively discussed to give a geometrical model of the reconstruction based on the shift of atomic rows. Quantitative evaluation of the intensity-time dependences results in the activation energy of the transition, $\Delta$E≈1.1 eV. From the temperature dependent measurements the surface Debye temperatures of the 1 × 1 and reconstructed phases are deduced to be roughly equal. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

abstract = {Spatially resolved techniques, such as photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) and ellipsomicroscopy for surface imaging (EMSI), have been particularly useful in the investigation of pattern formation during CO oxidation on platinum catalysts. One surprising result of these studies has been the discovery of subsurface oxygen on Pt(1 0 0). The formation of subsurface oxygen has been reported previously on Pt(1 0 0) during CO oxidation at low pressures (<1 × 10-4 Torr). This communication reports the formation of subsurface oxygen at intermediate pressures (∼0.1 Torr). These observations show that subsurface oxygen plays a role in catalytic CO oxidation and pattern formation, which has implications for catalysts operated at higher pressures. New microkinetic models of CO oxidation that incorporate subsurface oxygen are discussed. Results of these models are qualitatively similar to experimental observations of subsurface oxygen, confirming the importance of this species in the reaction dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The kinetics of the CO oxidation reaction were examined on the Pt(100)-(5 × 20) surface under UHV conditions. The transient isothermal rate of CO2 production was examined both for exposure of an oxygen-dosed surface to a beam of CO and for exposure of a CO-dosed surface to a beam of O2. Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics were found to apply in both cases. For the reaction of CO with preadsorbed oxygen atoms, the reaction rate was dependent upon the square-root of the oxygen atom coverage, suggesting that oxygen atoms were adsorbed in islands on this surface. The oxidation of preadsorbed CO was observed only when the initial CO concentrations were less than 0.5 monolayer (c(2 × 2) structure), suggesting that the dissociative adsorption of oxygen required adjacent four-fold surface sites. The activation energy calculated for the reaction of CO with preadsorbed oxygen was 31.4 kcal/mol. This value was 30 kcal/mol greater than the activation energy measured for the reaction of O2 with preadsorbed CO. Strong attractive interactions within the oxygen islands were at least partially responsible for this difference. The reaction kinetics in both cases changed dramatically below 300 K; this change is believed to be due to phase separation at the lower temperature. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

abstract = {We report accurate time-resolved measurements of NH3 desorption from Pt(111) and Pt(332) and use these results to determine elementary rate constants for desorption from steps, from (111) terrace sites and for diffusion on (111) terraces. Modeling the extracted rate constants with transition state theory, we find that conventional models for partition functions, which rely on uncoupled degrees of freedom (DOFs), are not able to reproduce the experimental observations. The results can be reproduced using a more sophisticated partition function, which couples DOFs that are most sensitive to NH3 translation parallel to the surface; this approach yields accurate values for the NH3 binding energy to Pt(111) (1.13 ± 0.02 eV) and the diffusion barrier (0.71 ± 0.04 eV). In addition, we determine NH3's binding energy preference for steps over terraces on Pt (0.23 ± 0.03 eV). The ratio of the diffusion barrier to desorption energy is ∼0.65, in violation of the so-called 12% rule. Using our derived diffusion/desorption rates, we explain why established rate models of the Ostwald process incorrectly predict low selectivity and yields of NO under typical reactor operating conditions. Our results suggest that mean-field kinetics models have limited applicability for modeling the Ostwald process.},

abstract = {Current best-practice lithographic techniques are unable to meet the functional requirements needed to enable on-chip plasmonic devices capable of fully exploiting nanostructure properties reliant on a tailored nanostructure size, composition, architecture, crystallinity, and placement. As a consequence, numerous nanofabrication methods have emerged that address various weaknesses, but none have, as of yet, demonstrated a large-area processing route capable of defining organized surfaces of nanostructures with the architectural diversity and complexity that is routinely displayed in colloidal syntheses. Here, a hybrid fabrication strategy is demonstrated in which nanoimprint lithography is combined with templated dewetting and liquid-phase syntheses that is able to realize periodic arrays of complex noble metal nanostructures over square centimeter areas. The process is inexpensive, can be carried out on a benchtop, and requires modest levels of instrumentation. Demonstrated are three fabrication schemes yielding arrays of core-shell, core-void-shell, and core-void-nanoframe structures using liquid-phase syntheses involving heteroepitaxial deposition, galvanic replacement, and dealloying. With the field of nanotechnology being increasingly reliant on the engineering of desirable physicochemical responses through architectural control, the fabrication strategy provides a platform for advancing devices reliant on addressable arrays or the collective response from an ensemble of identical nanostructures.},

Surface energy and related catalytic mechanisms are widely studied. However, the catalyst lattice deformation induced by catalytic processes is not well understood. Here, we study the strain in an individual platinum (Pt) nanoparticle (NP) using Bragg coherent diffraction imaging under in situ oxidation and reduction reactions. When Pt NPs are exposed to H2O2, a typical oxidizer and an intermediate during the oxygen reduction reaction process, alternating overall strain distribution near the surface and inside the NP is observed at the (111) Bragg reflection. In contrast, relatively insignificant changes appear in the (200) reflection. Density functional theory calculations are employed to rationalize the anisotropic lattice strain in terms of induced stress by H2O2 adsorption and decomposition on the Pt NP surface. Our study provides deeper insight into the activity-structure relationship in this system.},

It is shown that this stable phase differs from the first one by a slight rotation of the hexagonal surface layer by 0.7°. For Ir(100) only the well known (1 × 5) superstructure is observed without any rotation of the outer layer. The rotation angle of 0.7° for platinum and the stability of the unrelated structure for iridium can be interpreted by simple calculations of the coordination of surface atoms with those of the second layer. The method assumes that the surface layer is of ideal hexagonal structure in the case of platinum and nearly hexagonal in the case of iridium.

abstract = {Iterative algorithms for phase retrieval from intensity data are compared to gradient search methods. Both the problem of phase retrieval from two intensity measurements (in electron microscopy or wave front sensing) and the problem of phase retrieval from a single intensity measurement plus a non-negativity constraint (in astronomy) are considered, with emphasis on the latter. It is shown that both the error-reduction algorithm for the problem of a single intensity measurement and the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm for the problem of two intensity measurements converge. The error-reduction algorithm is also shown to be closely related to the steepest-descent method. Other algorithms, including the input-output algorithm and the conjugate-gradient method, are shown to converge in practice much faster than the error-reduction algorithm. Examples are shown.},

abstract = {Nanoparticles are essential electrocatalysts in chemical production, water treatment and energy conversion, but engineering efficient and specific catalysts requires understanding complex structure-reactivity relations. Recent experiments have shown that Bragg coherent diffraction imaging might be a powerful tool in this regard. The technique provides three-dimensional lattice strain fields from which surface reactivity maps can be inferred. However, all experiments published so far have investigated particles an order of magnitude larger than those used in practical applications. Studying smaller particles quickly becomes demanding as the diffracted intensity falls. Here, in situ nanodiffraction data from 60 nm Au nanoparticles under electrochemical control collected at the hard X-ray nanoprobe beamline of MAX IV, NanoMAX, are presented. Two-dimensional image reconstructions of these particles are produced, and it is estimated that NanoMAX, which is now open for general users, has the requisites for three-dimensional imaging of particles of a size relevant for catalytic applications. This represents the first demonstration of coherent X-ray diffraction experiments performed at a diffraction-limited storage ring, and illustrates the importance of these new sources for experiments where coherence properties become crucial.},

abstract = {Single-shot wide-angle diffraction imaging is a widely used method to investigate the structure of non-crystallizing objects such as nanoclusters, large proteins or even viruses. Its main advantage is that information about the three-dimensional structure of the object is already contained in a single image. This makes it useful for the reconstruction of fragile and non-reproducible particles without the need for tomographic measurements. However, currently there is no efficient numerical inversion algorithm available that is capable of determining the object's structure in real time. Neural networks, on the other hand, excel in image processing tasks suited for such purpose. Here we show how a physics-informed deep neural network can be used to reconstruct complete three-dimensional object models on a voxel grid from single two-dimensional wide-angle scattering patterns. We demonstrate its universal reconstruction capabilities for silver nanoclusters, where the network uncovers novel geometric structures that reproduce the experimental scattering data with very high precision.},

Our observation suggests that the elemental segregation of nanoparticle catalysts should be highly active during heterogeneous catalysis and can be a controlling factor in synthesis of electrocatalysts. In addition, our study exemplifies applications of BCDI for in situ 3D imaging of internal equilibrium compositions in other bimetallic alloy nanoparticles.},

However, as the scattering volume is reduced, the difference between the Rayleigh (coherent) and Compton (incoherent) contributions at Bragg peaks diminishes and the incoherent part may become substantial. The consequences can be significant for coherent diffraction imaging at high scattering angles: the incoherent radiation produces background that smears out the secondary interference fringes, affecting thus the achievable resolution of the technique. Here, a criterion that relates the object shape and the resolution is introduced. The Compton contribution for several object shapes is quantified, and it is shown that the maximum achievable resolution along different directions has a strong dependence on the crystal shape and size.},

By employing an iterative algorithm, the phase information from the oversampled diffraction pattern of a micrometre-sized test specimen has been successfully retrieved. This method is believed to be able to open a door for high-resolution three-dimensional structure determination of complex and non-crystalline biological specimens, i.e. whole cells and sub-micrometre molecular clusters and micrometre-sized protein crystals.

abstract = {Reconstructing the high-resolution volumetric 3D shape from images is challenging due to the cubic growth of computational cost. In this paper, we propose a Fourier-based method that reconstructs a 3D shape from images in a 2D space by predicting slices in the frequency domain. According to the Fourier slice projection theorem, we introduce a thickness map to bridge the domain gap between images in the spatial domain and slices in the frequency domain. The thickness map is the 2D spatial projection of the 3D shape, which is easily predicted from the input image by a general convolutional neural network. Each slice in the frequency domain is the Fourier transform of the corresponding thickness map. All slices constitute a 3D descriptor and the 3D shape is the inverse Fourier transform of the descriptor. Using slices in the frequency domain, our method can transfer the 3D shape reconstruction from the 3D space into the 2D space, which significantly reduces the computational cost. The experiment results on the ShapeNet dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art reconstruction methods.},

We demonstrate the approach on experimental coherent Bragg diffraction data measured with 52 keV x-rays from a nanocrystalline sample. From this sample, we resolve the fine fringe detail of a high-energy x-ray Bragg coherent diffraction pattern to an upsampling factor of 16 of the native pixel pitch of 30 &#x03BC;m of a charge-integrating fastCCD detector. This was accomplished by analysis of individual photon locations in a series of &#x201C;nearly-dark&#x201D; instances of the diffraction pattern that each contain only a handful of photons. Central to our approach was the adaptation of the UNLOC photon fitting routine for PALM/STORM to the hard x-ray regime to handle much smaller point spread functions, which required a different statistical test for photon detection and for sub-pixel localization. A comparison to a photon-localization strategy used in the x-ray community (&#x201C;droplet analysis&#x201D;) showed that XR-UNLOC provides significant improvement in super-resolution. We also developed a metric by which to estimate the limit of reliable upsampling with XR-UNLOC under a given set of experimental conditions in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio of a photon detection event and the size of the point spread function for guiding future x-ray experiments in many disciplines where detector pixelation limits must be overcome.},

Indeed, at the nanoscale, their functional properties are largely influenced by elastic strain and depend critically on the presence of crystal defects. It is thus of prime importance to be able to monitor, by noninvasive means, the stability of the microstructure of nano-objects against external stimuli such as mechanical load. Here we demonstrate the potential of Bragg coherent diffraction imaging for such measurements, by imaging in 3D the evolution of the microstructure of a nanocrystal exposed to in situ mechanical loading. Not only could we observe the evolution of the internal strain field after successive loadings, but we also evidenced a transient microstructure hosting a stable dislocation loop. The latter is fully characterized from its characteristic displacement field. The mechanical behavior of this small crystal is clearly at odds with what happens in bulk materials where many dislocations interact. Moreover, this original in situ experiment opens interesting possibilities for the investigation of plastic deformation at the nanoscale.},

New methods are described that allow the algorithm to overcome three different modes of stagnation: those characterized by (1) twin images, (2) stripes, and (3) truncation of the image by the support constraint. Curious properties of Fourier transforms of images are also described: the zero reversal for the striped images and the relationship between the zero lines of the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier transform.

annote = {The importance of the Brillouin zone stems from the description of waves in a periodic medium given by Bloch's theorem, in which it is found that the solutions can be completely characterized by their behavior in a single Brillouin zone.

The first Brillouin zone is the locus of points in reciprocal space that are closer to the origin of the reciprocal lattice than they are to any other reciprocal lattice points (see the derivation of the Wigner–Seitz cell). Another definition is as the set of points in k-space that can be reached from the origin without crossing any Bragg plane.

A related concept is that of the irreducible Brillouin zone, which is the first Brillouin zone reduced by all of the symmetries in the point group of the lattice (point group of the crystal).},

However, the undersampling of the diffraction signal due to Fourier-space compression at high x-ray energies renders conventional phase-retrieval algorithms unsuitable for three-dimensional reconstruction. To address this problem, we utilize a phase-retrieval method with a Fourier constraint specifically tailored for undersampled diffraction data measured with coarse-pitched detector pixels that bin the underlying signal. With our approach, we show that it is possible to reconstruct three-dimensional strained crystallites from an undersampled Bragg diffraction data set subject to pixel-area integration without having to physically upsample the diffraction signal. Using simulations and experimental results, we demonstrate that explicit modeling of Fourier-space compression during phase retrieval provides a viable means by which to invert high-energy BCDI data, which is otherwise intractable.},

This presents opportunities for "defect engineering," where desired functionalities are generated through defect manipulation. However, imaging defects in working devices with nanoscale resolution remains elusive. We report three-dimensional imaging of dislocation dynamics in individual battery cathode nanoparticles under operando conditions using Bragg coherent diffractive imaging. Dislocations are static at room temperature and mobile during charge transport. During the structural phase transformation, the lithium-rich phase nucleates near the dislocation and spreads inhomogeneously. The dislocation field is a local probe of elastic properties, and we find that a region of the material exhibits a negative Poisson's ratio at high voltage. Operando dislocation imaging thus opens a powerful avenue for facilitating improvement and rational design of nanostructured materials.},

However, this rapid development in terms of hardware has not been matched on the software side. The release of Hawk is intended to close this gap. To the authors knowledge Hawk is the first publicly available and fully open source software program for reconstructing images from continuous diffraction patterns. The software handles all steps leading from a raw diffraction pattern to a reconstructed two-dimensional image including geometry determination, background correction, masking and phasing. It also includes preliminary three-dimensional support and support for graphics processing units using the Compute Unified Device Architecture, which speeds up processing by orders of magnitude compared to a single central processing unit. Hawk implements numerous algorithms and is easily extended.

The method can potentially reach nanometer-scale spatial resolution thanks to the advances in synchrotron design that dramatically increase coherent flux. However, there are experimental bottlenecks that may limit the image reconstruction quality from future high signal-to-noise ratio measurements. In this work we show that angular uncertainty of the sample orientation with respect to a fixed incoming beam is one example of such a factor, and we present a method to mitigate the resulting artifacts. On the basis of an alternative formulation of the forward problem, we design a phase retrieval algorithm which enables the simultaneous reconstruction of the object and determination of the exact angular position corresponding to each diffraction pattern in the data set. We have tested the algorithm performance on simulated data for different degrees of angular uncertainty and signal-to-noise ratio.},

Most conventional phase retrieval methods have used iterative processes to recover phase information; however, the calculation speed and convergence with these methods are serious issues in real-time monitoring applications. Machine-learning-based methods are promising for addressing these issues. Here, we numerically compare conventional methods and a machine-learning-based method in which a convolutional neural network is employed. Simulations with several conditions show that the machine-learning-based method realizes fast and robust phase recovery compared with the conventional methods. We also numerically demonstrate machine-learning-based phase retrieval from noisy measurements with a noisy training data set for improving the noise robustness. The machine-learning-based approach used in this study may increase the impact of phase retrieval, which is useful in various fields, where phase retrieval has been used as a fundamental tool.},

abstract = {Ptychography is a rapidly developing scanning microscopy which is able to view the internal structures of samples at a high resolution beyond the illumination size. The achieved spatial resolution is theoretically dose-limited. A broadband source can provide much higher flux compared with a monochromatic source; however, it conflicts with the necessary coherence requirements of this coherent diffraction imaging technique. In this paper, a multi-wavelength reconstruction algorithm has been developed to deal with the broad bandwidth in ptychography. Compared with the latest development of mixed-state reconstruction approach, this multi-wavelength approach is more accurate in the physical model, and also considers the spot size variation as a function of energy due to the chromatic focusing optics. Therefore, this method has been proved in both simulation and experiment to significantly improve the reconstruction when the source bandwidth, illumination size and scan step size increase. It is worth mentioning that the accurate and detailed information of the energy spectrum for the incident beam is not required in advance for the proposed method. Further, we combine multi-wavelength and mixed-state approaches to jointly solve temporal and spatial partial coherence in ptychography so that it can handle various disadvantageous experimental effects. The significant relaxation in coherence requirements by our approaches allows the use of high-flux broadband X-ray sources for high-efficient and high-resolution ptychographic imaging.},

The system consists of a PLD chamber mounted on a diffractometer allowing both real-time surface X-ray diffraction (SXRD) and in situ hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES). HAXPES is performed in the incident X-ray energy range from 4 to 12 keV using a Scienta EW4000 electron energy analyzer mounted on the PLD chamber fixed parallel with the surface normal. In addition to the standard application mode of HAXPES for disentangling surface from bulk properties, the increased penetration depth of high energy photoelectrons is used for investigation of the electronic structure changes through thin films grown deliberately as variable thickness capping layers. Such heterostructures represent model systems for investigating a variety of critical thickness and dead layer phenomena observed at complex oxide interfaces. In this new mode of operation, in situ HAXPES is used to determine the electronic structure associated with unique structural features identified by real-time SXRD during thin film growth. The system is configured for using both laboratory excitation sources off-line and on-line operation at beamline 33-ID-D at the Advanced Photon Source. We illustrate the performance of the system by preliminary scattering and spectroscopic data on oxygen vacancy ordering induced perovskite-to-brownmillerite reversible phase transformation in La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 films capped with oxygen deficient SrTiO3-$\delta$ (100) layers of varying thickness.},

abstract = {The evolution of morphology and internal strain under high pressure fundamentally alters the physical property, structural stability, phase transition and deformation mechanism of materials. Until now, only averaged strain distributions have been studied. Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging is highly sensitive to the internal strain distribution of individual crystals but requires coherent illumination, which can be compromised by the complex high-pressure sample environment. Here we report the successful de-convolution of these effects with the recently developed mutual coherent function method to reveal the three-dimensional strain distribution inside a 400 nm gold single crystal during compression within a diamond-anvil cell. The three-dimensional morphology and evolution of the strain under pressures up to 6.4 GPa were obtained with better than 30 nm spatial resolution. In addition to providing a new approach for high-pressure nanotechnology and rheology studies, we draw fundamental conclusions about the origin of the anomalous compressibility of nanocrystals. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Different complex domain configurations are revealed along the wires with a 9 nm in-plane spatial resolution. We demonstrate that the IDBs change their direction of propagation along the wires, promoting Ga-terminated domains and stabilizing into {11¯ 00}, that is, m-planes. The atomic phase shift between the Ga- and N-terminated domains was extracted using phase-retrieval algorithms, revealing an evolution of the out-of-plane displacement (∼5 pm, at maximum) between inversion domains along the wires.

abstract = {Imaging with low-dose light is of importance in various fields, especially when minimizing radiation-induced damage onto samples is desirable. The raw image captured at the detector plane is then predominantly a Poisson random process with Gaussian noise added due to the quantum nature of photo-electric conversion. Under such noisy conditions, highly ill-posed problems such as phase retrieval from raw intensity measurements become prone to strong artifacts in the reconstructions; a situation that deep neural networks (DNNs) have already been shown to be useful at improving. Here, we demonstrate that random phase modulation on the optical field, also known as coherent modulation imaging (CMI), in conjunction with the phase extraction neural network (PhENN) and a Gerchberg-Saxton-Fienup (GSF) approximant, further improves resilience to noise of the phase-from-intensity imaging problem. We offer design guidelines for implementing the CMI hardware with the proposed computational reconstruction scheme and quantify reconstruction improvement as function of photon count.},

On the other hand, non-destructive X-ray imaging methods either have a reduced resolution or are not robust enough for a broad range of applications. Here we present X-ray ptychographic topography, a new method for strain imaging, and demonstrate its use on an InSb micro-pillar after micro-compression, where the strained region is visualized with a spatial resolution of 30 nm. Thereby, X-ray ptychographic topography proves itself as a robust non-destructive approach for the imaging of strain fields within bulk crystalline specimens with a spatial resolution of a few tens of nanometers.},

Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (BCDI) has emerged as a powerful tool capable of identifying dislocations, twin domains, and other defects in 3D detail with nanometer spatial resolution within nanocrystals and grains in reactive environments. However, BCDI relies on phase retrieval algorithms that can fail to accurately reconstruct the defect network. Here, we use numerical simulations to explore different guided phase retrieval algorithms for imaging defective crystals using BCDI. We explore different defect types, defect densities, Bragg peaks, and guided algorithm fitness metrics as a function of signal-to-noise ratio. Based on these results, we offer a general prescription for phasing of defective crystals with no a priori knowledge.},

The experiment was performed at a temperature of 400 K under continuous gas flow conditions of pure Ar and Ar/CO mixtures. The nanoparticle was preselected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and postanalyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). We obtain a very good agreement between the overall nanoparticle size, shape, and defect structure as determined by CXDI and AFM. In addition, we compare the strain state in the nanoparticle near surface region and its bulk: For pure Ar flow, we find a slight compressive strain in the nanoparticle bulk compared to an expansion in the near surface region. We ascribe the latter to the presence of high index vicinal surfaces. Our analysis suggests that under mixed Ar/CO flow at 400 K reshaping of the nanoparticle occurred. New high index facets developed, leading to a stronger lattice expansion, also propagating into the nanoparticle bulk. Our high-resolution experiments pave the way for future CXDI experiments under operando catalytic reaction conditions.},

Coherent diffraction imaging at Bragg reflections offers picometre sensitivity to lattice distortions in crystals and access to the full strain tensor, in the case where three or more non-coplanar reflections are measured. Defects may have a strong effect on the physical properties of materials. As the majority of defects produce lattice distortions, hence these can be imaged. Here we describe the instrumentation at ID01 required to produce such foci and the protocols employed to ensure reliable data acquisition. The wavefront of the incident beam must be coherent in order to observe interference. Thus the coherent probe is recovered online via ptychography on a reference structure at the beginning of every experiment, and can be executed at any time to confirm beam quality and maintain experimental consistency. Due to the small source size in the vertical direction a diffraction limited spot is achieved, whereas in the horizontal the beam size is defined by the image of the source. With the upgrade of the ESRF this asymmetry is supposed to decrease substantially, and will be accompanied by an increase in coherent flux density by a factor of 30–100.},

abstract = {The focus on surface lattice strain in nanostructures as a fundamental research topic has gained momentum in recent years as scientists investigated its significant impact on the surface electronic structure and catalytic properties of nanomaterials. Researchers have begun to tell a more complete story of catalysis from a perspective which brings this concept to the forefront of the discussion. The nano-'realm' makes the effects of surface lattice strain, which acts on the same spatial scales, more pronounced due to a higher ratio of surface to bulk atoms. This is especially evident in the field of metal nanoparticle catalysis, where displacement of atoms on surfaces can significantly alter the sorption properties of molecules. In part, the concept of strain-engineering for catalysis opened up due to the achievements that were made in the synthesis of a more sophisticated nanoparticle library from an ever-expanding set of methodologies. Developing synthesis methods for metal nanoparticles with well-defined and strained architectures is a worthy goal that, if reached, will have considerable impact in the search for catalysts. In this review, we summarize the recent accomplishments in the area of surface lattice-strained metal nanoparticle synthesis, framing the discussion from the important perspective of surface lattice strain effects in catalysis.},

In this paper an algorithm is presented which allows automated quantitative 3D analysis of facets of many particles within tomographic datasets.

The result consists of lists containing number of detected facets, their size, global orientation and the interplanar angles between facets for each analyzed particle. Characterization of each particle according to any of these facet properties is then possible, e.g. statistics about different crystal shapes or removal of particles that do not show significant faceting.

abstract = {Ptychographic imaging is a powerful means of imaging beyond the resolution limits of typical x-ray optics. Recovering images from raw ptychographic data, however, requires the solution of an inverse problem, namely, phase retrieval. Phase retrieval algorithms are computationally expensive, which precludes real-time imaging. In this work, we propose PtychoNN, an approach to solve the ptychography data inversion problem based on a deep convolutional neural network. We demonstrate how the proposed method can be used to predict real-space structure and phase at each scan point solely from the corresponding far-field diffraction data. Our results demonstrate the practical application of machine learning to recover high fidelity amplitude and phase contrast images of a real sample hundreds of times faster than current ptychography reconstruction packages. Furthermore, by overcoming the constraints of iterative model-based methods, we can significantly relax sampling constraints on data acquisition while still producing an excellent image of the sample. Besides drastically accelerating acquisition and analysis, this capability has profound implications for the imaging of dose sensitive, dynamic, and extremely voluminous samples.},

We show that the Shannon sampling of diffraction intensities needed in CDI requires a coherence width about twice the lateral dimensions of the object, and that the linear number of detector pixels fixes the energy spread needed in the beam. The Shannon sampling, defined by the transform of the periodically repeated autocorrelation of the object, is related to Bragg scattering from an equivalent crystal, and shown to be consistent with the sampling of Young's fringes established by scattering from extreme points in the object. The results are relevant to the design of diffraction cameras for CDI and plans for femotosecond X-ray diffraction from individual proteins. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

(2) Evidence-based policy interests may have legitimate roles to play in influencing aspects of the research process, but those roles should not interfere with scientific integrity. The nine best practices for instilling scientific integrity in the implementation of these two overarching principles are (1) Require universal training in robust scientific methods, in the use of appropriate experimental design and statistics, and in responsible research practices for scientists at all levels, with the training content regularly updated and presented by qualified scientists. (2) Strengthen scientific integrity oversight and processes throughout the research continuum with a focus on training in ethics and conduct. (3) Encourage reproducibility of research through transparency. (4) Strive to establish open science as the standard operating procedure throughout the scientific enterprise. (5) Develop and implement educational tools to teach communication skills that uphold scientific integrity. (6) Strive to identify ways to further strengthen the peer review process. (7) Encourage scientific journals to publish unanticipated findings that meet standards of quality and scientific integrity. (8) Seek harmonization and implementation among journals of rapid, consistent, and transparent processes for correction and/or retraction of published papers.

To improve catalyst efficiency, it is important to understand oxidation processes on the atomic scale.

The X-ray results on the particle morphology were complemented by transmission electron microscopy studies. The samples were prepared by means of physical vapor deposition and differed in average particle size and lateral particle size distribution. The oxygen-induced particle shape changes were found to be independent of particle size and were characterized by the emergence of higher indexed facets. We find the bulk oxide formation to be kinetically hindered and particle size-dependent. The formed bulk oxide structures were concluded to be (110)-oriented Pt3O4 and a modified structure of (0001)-oriented $\alpha$-PtO2.CO exposure of the oxidized particles did not lead to a shape change reversibility.},

abstract = {X-ray ptychography is a rapidly developing coherent diffraction imaging technique that provides nanoscale resolution on extended field-of-view. However, the requirement of coherence and the scanning mechanism limit the throughput of ptychographic imaging. In this paper, we propose X-ray ptychography using multiple illuminations instead of single illumination in conventional ptychography. Multiple locations of the sample are simultaneously imaged by spatially separated X-ray beams, therefore, the obtained field-of-view in one scan can be enlarged by a factor equal to the number of illuminations. We have demonstrated this technique experimentally using two X-ray beams focused by a house-made Fresnel zone plate array. Two areas of the object and corresponding double illuminations were successfully reconstructed from diffraction patterns acquired in one scan, with image quality similar with those obtained by conventional single-beam ptychography in sequence. Multi-beam ptychography approach increases the imaging speed, providing an efficient way for high-resolution imaging of large extended specimens.},

Vacuum annealing at temperatures above 800 K led to significant Pt sintering that reduced CO uptake to a much higher extent than the Pt surface area. A similar effect on CO adsorption was observed after mild oxidation-reduction treatment at 500 K. The results are rationalized in terms of the strong metal-support interaction between Pt and Fe3O4, whereby the Pt particles were encapsulated by a FeO (111) monolayer film as shown by STM. The high adhesion energy between Pt and iron oxides derived from STM data is suggested to be the key factor for encapsulation. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Au/CeO2 (0.25% wt. Au) catalysts were prepared by anchoring preformed Au nanoparticles over ceria polycrystals, cubes and rods and tested in the oxidation of CO and COPrOx. The use of preformed Au nanoparticles assured a constant Au particle size (ca. 5 nm by HRTEM) for all samples, which allowed to a precise assessment of the effect of the morphology of nanoshaped ceria on catalytic activity. The catalytic performance of the Au/CeO2-rods was much better than that of the Au/CeO2-polycrystals and Au/CeO2-cubes both in the oxidation of CO and COPrOx reactions. The Au/CeO2-rods exhibited the highest amount of oxidized Au and Ce(III) species by XPS, whereas in the Au/CeO2-cubes gold was totally metallic and the amount of Ce(III) was minimum. An intermediate situation was encountered in the Au/CeO2-polycrystals. Considering the differences in the oxidation states of Au and Ce and the fact that all samples were prepared with preformed metallic Au nanoparticles of the same size, the results indicate that the intrinsic nature of the different ceria surfaces exerts a prominent role in the gold-ceria interaction and in the electron density transfer from Au to Ce, which in turn has a strong effect on catalytic activity. Gold nanoparticles strongly interact with CeO2-{1 1 0} surfaces with respect to CeO2-{1 1 1} and CeO2-{1 0 0}, even when Au nanoparticles are prepared separately and simply deposited by impregnation.},

The current process of phase recovery is iterative in nature. As a result, the image formation is time-consuming and computationally expensive, precluding real-time imaging. Here, we use 3D nanoscale X-ray imaging as a representative example to develop a deep learning model to address this phase retrieval problem. We introduce 3D-CDI-NN, a deep convolutional neural network and differential programming framework trained to predict 3D structure and strain solely from input 3D X-ray coherent scattering data. Our networks are designed to be ‘physics-aware' in multiple aspects; in that the physics of x-ray scattering process is explicitly enforced in the training of the network, and the training data are drawn from atomistic simulations that are representative of the physics of the material. We further refine the neural network prediction through a physics-based optimization procedure to enable maximum accuracy at lowest computational cost. 3D-CDI-NN can invert a 3D coherent diffraction pattern to real-space structure and strain hundreds of times faster than traditional iterative phase retrieval methods, with negligible loss in accuracy. Our integrated machine learning and differential programming solution to the phase retrieval problem is broadly applicable across inverse problems in other application areas.},

The capability of present-day synchrotrons to locate and measure a multiplicity of Bragg reflections from a single grain makes it possible to recover the full strain tensor with nanometer resolution. Recent methods for coupling reconstructions from several peaks to determine the strain tensor have been developed and applied to synthetic data, but have not been applied to experimental data. Here, using a coupled genetic reconstruction algorithm, we reconstruct an experimental data set and demonstrate improvements in the ability to resolve vector-valued displacement fields internal to the particle as compared to what is achieved with a noncoupled approach. The coupled approach developed in this work was also validated on simulated data sets. In both simulated and experimental data, reconstructions from our coupled Bragg peak algorithm show improvements over the noncoupled independent reconstruction method of 5% in terms of accuracy and 53% in terms of consistency.},

abstract = {Measurement modalities in Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) rely on finding a signal from a single nanoscale crystal object which satisfies the Bragg condition among a large number of arbitrarily oriented nanocrystals. However, even when the signal from a single Bragg reflection with (hkl) Miller indices is found, the crystallographic axes on the retrieved three-dimensional (3D) image of the crystal remain unknown, and thus localizing in reciprocal space other Bragg reflections becomes time-consuming or requires good knowledge of the orientation of the crystal. Here, the commissioning of a movable double-bounce Si (111) monochromator at the 34-ID-C endstation of the Advanced Photon Source is reported, which aims at delivering multi-reflection BCDI as a standard tool in a single beamline instrument. The new instrument enables, through rapid switching from monochromatic to broadband (pink) beam, the use of Laue diffraction to determine crystal orientation. With a proper orientation matrix determined for the lattice, one can measure coherent diffraction patterns near multiple Bragg peaks, thus providing sufficient information to image the full strain tensor in 3D. The design, concept of operation, the developed procedures for indexing Laue patterns, and automated measuring of Bragg coherent diffraction data from multiple reflections of the same nanocrystal are discussed.},

abstract = {The molecular mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation on a Ni(111) surface has been thoroughly investigated by means of periodic density functional theory calculations, including dispersion interactions, along with accurate kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, including lateral interactions between the adsorbates. The present reaction model involves 25 different species and a total of 86 elementary processes, including adsorptions, desorptions, surface chemical steps, and diffusions. The reaction network accounts for three different mechanisms for the reverse water-gas shift reaction and three different mechanisms for methanation. The kinetic Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the reverse water-gas shift reaction dominates the CO2 hydrogenation on Ni(111) with no evidence of methane formation. The reaction proceeds mainly through the redox route, with the carboxyl pathway also being active but to a lesser extent. Methane production is hindered by the H + CO → HCO endothermicity and the prohibitive energy barrier for CO dissociation, implying CO desorption rather than evolution through the Sabatier reaction. A detailed comparison to earlier theoretical studies supporting the methanation reaction shows that some unreliable assumptions along with limited theoretical approaches biased the former conclusion.},

abstract = {Atomic-level defects such as dislocations play key roles in determining the macroscopic properties of crystalline materials. Their effects range from increased chemical reactivity to enhanced mechanical properties. Dislocations have been widely studied using traditional techniques such as X-ray diffraction and optical imaging. Recent advances have enabled atomic force microscopy to study single dislocations in two dimensions, while transmission electron microscopy (TEM) can now visualize strain fields in three dimensions with near-atomic resolution. However, these techniques cannot offer three-dimensional imaging of the formation or movement of dislocations during dynamic processes. Here, we describe how Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI; refs,) can be used to visualize in three dimensions, the entire network of dislocations present within an individual calcite crystal during repeated growth and dissolution cycles. These investigations demonstrate the potential of BCDI for studying the mechanisms underlying the response of crystalline materials to external stimuli.},

abstract = {In the search for precious-metal-free electrode materials for electrochemical water splitting, transition-metal oxides have been receiving much recent interest as active and stable electrocatalysts for the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We present operando surface X-ray diffraction studies of two structurally well-defined epitaxial cobalt oxide thin films: Co3O4(111) and CoOOH(001) electrodeposited on Au(111). The potential-dependent structural changes during cyclic voltammograms were monitored with high time resolution up to OER current densities as high as 150 mA cm-2. The CoOOH(001) film is found to be smooth and perfectly stable over a wide potential range. In the case of Co3O4(111), fast and fully reversible structural changes are observed. Specifically, the surface region of Co3O4(111) starts restructuring at potentials 300 mV negative of the onset of the OER, indicating that the process is related to the thermodynamically predicted Co3O4/CoOOH(001) transition rather than to the catalytic reaction. The formed skin layer is of defined thickness, which changes linearly with applied potential, and is the OER active phase. Surprisingly, the catalytic activity of the skin layer covered Co3O4 film and that of the smooth CoOOH(001) are almost identical, if the true microscopic surface area is taken into account. This indicates that the number of OER active sites on the two oxides is similar, despite the very different defect density, and is at variance with previous suggestions that di-$\mu$-oxo bridged Co cations are exclusively responsible for the OER activity of Co oxides. For the smooth CoOOH(001), a turnover frequency of 4.2 s-1 per surface atom is determined at an overpotential of 400 mV. Furthermore, our studies demonstrate that the pseudocapacitive charging current in the pre-OER potential range must be assigned to a bulk process that is accompanied by potential-dependent changes of the unit cell volume in the Co3O4 bulk.},

abstract = {By using phase retrieval, Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (BCDI) allows tracking of three-dimensional displacement fields inside individual nanocrystals. Nevertheless, during structural phase transformations, significant strains (1% and higher) are common, and BCDI fails due to the Bragg peak distortions. Here we present and advanced BCDI algorithm enabling imaging three-dimensional strain fields in highly strained crystals with separated structural phases. We test the algorithm on particles simulated to undergo a structural phase transformation. While the conventional algorithms fail in unambiguously reconstructing the phase morphology, our algorithm correctly retrieves the morphology of coexistent phases with a strain difference of 1%. The key novelty is the simultaneous reconstruction of multiple scans of the same nanoparticle at snapshots through the phase transformations. The algorithm enables visualizing phase transformations in nanoparticles of lithium-ion, sodium-ion nanoparticles, and other nanoparticulate materials in working conditions (operando).},

abstract = {Multi-wavelength (mw) Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging (BCDI) is demonstrated on a single Au particle. The multi-wavelength Bragg diffraction patterns are inverted using conventional phase-retrieval algorithms where the dilation of the effective pixel size of a pixelated 2D detector caused by the variation of the X-ray beam energy is mitigated by interpolating the raw data. The reconstructed Bragg electron density and phase field are in excellent agreement with the results obtained from conventional rocking scans of the same particle. Voxel sizes of about 63 nm3 are obtained for reconstructions from both approaches. Phase shifts as small as 0.41 rad, which correspond to displacements of 14 pm and translate into strain resolution better than 10-4 in the Au particle, are resolved. The displacement field changes shape during the experiment, which is well reproduced by finite element method simulations considering an inhomogeneous strained carbon layer deposited on the Au particle over the course of the measurements. These experiments thus demonstrate the very high sensitivity of BCDI and mw-BCDI to strain induced by contaminations. Furthermore, mw-BCDI offers new opportunities for in situ and operando 3D strain imaging in complex sample environments.},

The uncertainty of the object support can lead to over-fitting and prevents an unambiguous metric evaluation of solutions. We propose to use a ‘free' log-likelihood indicator, where a small percentage of points are masked from the reconstruction algorithms, as an unbiased metric to evaluate the validity of computed solutions, independent of the sample studied. We also show how a set of solutions can be analysed through an eigen-decomposition to yield a better estimate of the real object. Example analysis on experimental data is presented both for a test pattern dataset, and the diffraction pattern from a live cyanobacteria cell. The method allows the validation of reconstructions on a wide range of materials (hard condensed or biological), and should be particularly relevant for 4th generation synchrotrons and X-ray free electron lasers, where large, high-throughput datasets require a method for unsupervised data evaluation.},

abstract = {Electrocatalysis is at the heart of a broad range of physicochemical applications that play an important role in the present and future of a sustainable economy. Among the myriad of different electrocatalysts used in this field, nanomaterials are of ubiquitous importance. An increased surface area/volume ratio compared to bulk makes nanoscale catalysts the preferred choice to perform electrocatalytic reactions. Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) was introduced in 2006 and since has been applied to obtain 3D images of crystalline nanomaterials. BCDI provides information about the displacement field, which is directly related to strain. Lattice strain in the catalysts impacts their electronic configuration and, consequently, their binding energy with reaction intermediates. Even though there have been significant improvements since its birth, the fact that the experiments can only be performed at synchrotron facilities and its relatively low resolution to date (∼10 nm spatial resolution) have prevented the popularization of this technique. Herein, we will briefly describe the fundamentals of the technique, including the electrocatalysis relevant information that we can extract from it. Subsequently, we review some of the computational experiments that complement the BCDI data for enhanced information extraction and improved understanding of the underlying nanoscale electrocatalytic processes. We next highlight success stories of BCDI applied to different electrochemical systems and in heterogeneous catalysis to show how the technique can contribute to future studies in electrocatalysis. Finally, we outline current challenges in spatiotemporal resolution limits of BCDI and provide our perspectives on recent developments in synchrotron facilities as well as the role of machine learning and artificial intelligence in addressing them.},

By examining the common principles that govern catalysis for different electrochemical reactions, we describe a systematic framework that clarifies trends in catalyzing these reactions, serving as a guide to new catalyst development while highlighting key gaps that need to be addressed.We conclude by extending this framework to emerging clean energy reactions such as hydrogen peroxide production, carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen reduction, where the development of improved catalysts could allow for the sustainable production of a broad range of fuels and chemicals.},

abstract = {Mesocrystals are nanostructured materials consisting of individual nanocrystals having a preferred crystallographic orientation. On mesoscopic length scales, the properties of mesocrystals are strongly affected by structural heterogeneity. Here, we report the detailed structural characterization of a faceted mesocrystal grain self-assembled from 60 nm sized gold nanocubes. Using coherent X-ray diffraction imaging, we determined the structure of the mesocrystal with the resolution sufficient to resolve each gold nanoparticle. The reconstructed electron density of the gold mesocrystal reveals its intrinsic structural heterogeneity, including local deviations of lattice parameters, and the presence of internal defects. The strain distribution shows that the average superlattice obtained by angular X-ray cross-correlation analysis and the real, "multidomain"structure of a mesocrystal are very close to each other, with a deviation less than 10\%. These results will provide an important impact to understanding the fundamental principles of structuring and self-assembly including ensuing properties of mesocrystals.},

Results showed significant increases in temperature for metal and ceria samples, which are compared with a lumped thermodynamic model, providing a tool for estimating beam heating effects.

abstract = {Many catalytic reactions under fixed conditions exhibit oscillatory behaviour. The oscillations are often attributed to dynamic changes in the catalyst surface. So far, however, such relationships were difficult to determine for catalysts consisting of supported nanoparticles. Here, we employ a nanoreactor to study the oscillatory CO oxidation catalysed by Pt nanoparticles using time-resolved high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, mass spectrometry and calorimetry. The observations reveal that periodic changes in the CO oxidation are synchronous with a periodic refacetting of the Pt nanoparticles. The oscillatory reaction is modelled using density functional theory and mass transport calculations, considering the CO adsorption energy and the oxidation rate as site-dependent. We find that to successfully explain the oscillations, the model must contain the phenomenon of refacetting. The nanoreactor approach can thus provide atomic-scale information that is specific to surface sites. This will improve the understanding of dynamic properties in catalysis and related fields. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {The X-ray Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) technique assumes that the structure factor holds constant over the measured crystal. This approximation breaks down for materials exhibiting variations in the unit-cell configuration, such as piezo- and ferroelectrics. In that case, the strain field cannot be reliably determined from the reconstruction because the lattice deformation and the structure factor contribute concomitantly. Proposed here is a solution to this problem achieved by combining Bragg CDI and the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction approach that measures a Friedel pair of reflections at two different photon energies near an absorption edge. Comparing the obtained reconstructions with a parametric model that includes calculating the scattering amplitude as a function of wavelength and the unit-cell configuration, the contributions of the lattice deformation and the structure factor are separated. Simulations of the ferroelectric material BaTiO3 demonstrate the possibility of simultaneous probing of the strain and displacement of the Ti atoms. The proposed method opens up an opportunity to apply coherent X-ray diffraction for nanoscale-resolved 3D mapping of polarization domains in micro- and nanocrystals.},

The ability to predict the structural evolution of catalytic nanocrystals during the reaction is of primary importance for catalyst design. However, to date, imaging and characterising the structure of defects inside a nanocrystal in three-dimensions and in situ during reaction has remained a challenge. We report here an unusual twin boundary migration process in a single platinum nanoparticle during CO oxidation using Bragg coherent diffraction imaging as the characterisation tool. Density functional theory calculations show that twin migration can be correlated with the relative change in the interfacial energies of the free surfaces exposed to CO. The x-ray technique also reveals particle reshaping during the reaction. In situ and non-invasive structural characterisation of defects during reaction opens new avenues for understanding defect behaviour in confined crystals and paves the way for strain and defect engineering.},

abstract = {Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging (BCDI) is a non-destructive, lensless method for 3D-resolved, nanoscale strain imaging in micro-crystals. A challenge, particularly for new users of the technique, is accurate mapping of experimental data, collected in the detector reciprocal space coordinate frame, to more convenient orthogonal coordinates, e.g. attached to the sample. This is particularly the case since different coordinate conventions are used at every BCDI beamline. The reconstruction algorithms and mapping scripts composed for individual beamlines are not readily interchangeable. To overcome this, a BCDI experiment simulation with a plugin script that converts all beamline angles to a universal, right-handed coordinate frame is introduced, making it possible to condense any beamline geometry into three rotation matrices. The simulation translates a user-specified 3D complex object to different BCDI-related coordinate frames. It also allows the generation of synthetic coherent diffraction data that can be inserted into any BCDI reconstruction algorithm to reconstruct the original user-specified object. Scripts are provided to map from sample space to detector conjugated space, detector conjugated space to sample space and detector conjugated space to detector conjugated space for a different reflection. This provides the reader with the basis for a flexible simulation tool kit that is easily adapted to different geometries. It is anticipated that this will find use in the generation of tailor-made supports for phasing of challenging data and exploration of novel geometries or data collection modalities.},

The current process of phase recovery is iterative in nature. As a result, the image formation is time-consuming and computationally expensive, precluding real-time imaging. Here, we use 3D nanoscale X-ray imaging as a representative example to develop a deep learning model to address this phase retrieval problem. We introduce 3D-CDI-NN, a deep convolutional neural network and differential programming framework trained to predict 3D structure and strain solely from input 3D X-ray coherent scattering data. Our networks are designed to be ‘physics-aware' in multiple aspects; in that the physics of x-ray scattering process is explicitly enforced in the training of the network, and the training data are drawn from atomistic simulations that are representative of the physics of the material. We further refine the neural network prediction through a physics-based optimization procedure to enable maximum accuracy at lowest computational cost. 3D-CDI-NN can invert a 3D coherent diffraction pattern to real-space structure and strain hundreds of times faster than traditional iterative phase retrieval methods, with negligible loss in accuracy. Our integrated machine learning and differential programming solution to the phase retrieval problem is broadly applicable across inverse problems in other application areas.},

abstract = {Multielectron transfer processes are crucially important in energy and biological science but require favorable catalysts to achieve fast kinetics. Nanostructuring catalysts can dramatically improve their properties, which can be difficult to understand due to strain- and size-dependent thermodynamics, the influence of defects, and substrate-dependent activities. Here, we report three-dimensional (3D) imaging of single gold nanoparticles during catalysis of ascorbic acid decomposition using Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (BCDI). Local strains were measured in single nanoparticles and modeled using reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) simulations and finite element analysis (FEA) simulations. RMD reveals the pathway for local strain generation in the gold lattice: chemisorption of hydroxyl ions. FEA reveals that the RMD results are transferable to the nanocrystal sizes studied in the experiment. Our study probes the strain-activity connection and opens a powerful avenue for theoretical and experimental studies of nanocrystal catalysis.},

abstract = {High-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature-programmed XPS at BESSY II have been applied to investigate the adsorption and desorption of NO on a Pt(1 1 1) surface. The coverage and temperature-dependent bonding configurations of NO have been identified from adsorbate O 1s and substrate Pt 4f7/2 core-level photoemission spectra, which were collected in situ during NO uptake or heating with data collection times per spectrum between 4 and 7 s. At 110 K, NO molecularly adsorbs on Pt(1 1 1) and sequentially populates three different adsorption sites. Up to coverages of 0.25 ML, only fcc-hollow sites are occupied, leading to the formation of a (2 × 2)-NO adsorbate structure. As coverage increases, in addition on-top sites are populated until at 0.5 ML a (2 × 2)-2NO structure is formed, which also represents the saturation structure at 250 K. Further increasing the coverage at 110 K leads to the occupation of hcp-hollow sites; at saturation, a (2 × 2)-3NO structure is observed with a coverage of 0.75 ML. Upon heating, the desorption of NO from the hcp-hollow sites gives rise to a desorption peak at 190 K. Further heating induces the desorption of on-top NO species starting at 275 K and fcc-hollow NO species starting at 320 K. No dissociation takes place. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

To fulfil their powerful potential, electrodes with increased capacity, faster charge rates, and longer cycle life must be developed. Understanding the mechanics and chemistry of individual nanoparticles under in situ conditions is a crucial step to improving performance and mitigating damage. Here we reveal three-dimensional strain evolution within a single nanoparticle of a promising high voltage cathode material, LiNi<inf>0.5</inf>Mn<inf>1.5</inf>O<inf>4</inf>, under in situ conditions. The particle becomes disconnected during the second charging cycle. This is attributed to the formation of a cathode electrolyte interphase layer with slow ionic conduction. The three-dimensional strain pattern within the particle is independent of cell voltage after disconnection, indicating that the particle is unable to redistribute lithium within its volume or to its neighbours. Understanding the disconnection process at the single particle level and the equilibrium or non-equilibrium state of nanoparticles is essential to improving performance of current and future electrochemical energy storage systems.},

However, it remains difficult to characterize the strain and defect evolution for a single nanocrystal catalyst in situ. Here, we report Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging of defect dynamics in an individual Pt nanoparticle during catalytic methane oxidation. We observed that the initially tensile strained regions of the crystal became seed points for the development of further strain and subsequent disappearance of diffraction density during oxidation reactions. Our detailed understanding of the catalytically induced deformation at the defect sites and observed reversibility during the relevant steps of the catalytic oxidation process provide important insights of defect control and engineering of heterogeneous catalysts.},

Using Bragg Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging, the uniformity of electrochemically synthesized model catalysts is studied, here high-index faceted tetrahexahedral (THH) platinum nanoparticles at ambient conditions. 3D images of an individual nanoparticle are obtained, assessing not only its shape but also the specific components of the displacement and strain fields both at the surface of the nanocrystal and inside. The study reveals structural diversity of shapes and defects, and shows that the THH platinum nanoparticles present strain build-up close to facets and edges. A facet recognition algorithm is further applied to the imaged nanoparticles and provides facet-dependent structural information for all measured nanoparticles. In the context of strain engineering for model catalysts, this study provides insight into the shape-controlled synthesis of platinum nanoparticles with high-index facets.},

This allows providing statistics to iden- tify dominant facet characteristics, while also finding deviations from the overall trend. The phase $\phi$ obtained by phase retrieval is related to the displacement of lattice points compared to the perfect lattice by the formula $\phi$ (r) = − Ghkl.u(r) + $\phi$0. For convenience, Ghkl was aligned after phase retrieval along the vertical axis z of the reference frame, so that $\phi$(r) = −‖Ghkl‖uz(r) + $\phi$0. The unknown offset $\phi$0 is often chosen such that the phase is null at the COM of the reconstructed modulus. It is therefore important to understand the reconstructed displacement as a displacement relative to the origin of phases. The strain component $\epsilon$zz is obtained as the gradient of the displacement
For nanoparticles 5 and 6, we excluded from the strain estimation the facets orthogonal to
the measurement direction: our measurement is not sensitive
to the surface relaxation in this facet geometry and the cosine
of the facet's angle with the measurement direction is close to
0, resulting in large error bars. 0.1\% is small 
The algorithm allows detecting a crystal's facet using the density of normals of each triangle of the surface mesh of the reconstruction. The surface normals point towards the same direction in the case of a facet; there- fore the local density of surface normals is large at that point. On contrary, if the surface is very rough, normals point in dif- ferent directions and the density is small (see},

Multimetallic nanomaterials serve as state-of-the-art electrocatalysts as a consequence of their unique physico-chemical properties. One method of enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of multimetallic nanomaterials is to tune or control the surface strain of the nanomaterials, and tremendous progress has been made in this area in the past decade. In this Review, we summarize advances in the introduction, tuning and quantification of strain in multimetallic nanocrystals to achieve more efficient energy conversion by electrocatalysis. First, we introduce the concept of strain and its correlation with other key physico-chemical properties. Then, using the electrocatalytic reduction of oxygen as a model reaction, we discuss the underlying mechanisms behind the strain-adsorption-reactivity relationship based on combined classical theories and models. We describe how this knowledge can be harnessed to design multimetallic nanocrystals with optimized strain to increase the efficiency of oxygen reduction. In particular, we highlight the unexpectedly beneficial (and previously overlooked) role of tensile strain from multimetallic nanocrystals in improving electrocatalysis. We conclude by outlining the challenges and offering our perspectives on the research directions in this burgeoning field.},

When two or more non-parallel facets are present, both the crystal orientation and the crystal facets can be identified. This enables facets to be rapidly indexed and uncommon facets, and planar defects, that have been difficult to study before to be identified.

However, BCDI relies on both dataset collection and phase retrieval algorithms that can induce artefacts in the reconstruction. Phase retrieval algorithms are based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT). We demonstrate how to calculate the displacement field inside a nanocrystal from its reconstructed phase depending on the mathematical convention used for the FFT. We use numerical simulations to quantify the influence of experimentally unavoidable detector deficiencies such as blind areas or limited dynamic range as well as post-processing filtering on the reconstruction. We also propose a criterion for the isosurface determination of the object, based on the histogram of the reconstructed modulus. Finally, we study the capability of the phasing algorithm to quantitatively retrieve the surface strain (i.e., the strain of the surface voxels). This work emphasizes many aspects that have been neglected so far in BCDI, which need to be understood for a quantitative analysis of displacement and strain based on this technique. It concludes with the optimization of experimental parameters to improve throughput and to establish BCDI as a reliable 3D nano-imaging technique.},

Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) allows strain to be measured with nanoscale 3D resolution. However, it is currently limited to materials that form microcrystals. Here we introduce a technique that allows the manufacture of BCDI samples from bulk materials. Using tungsten as an example, we show that focused ion-beam machining can be used to extract, from macroscopic crystals, micron-sized BCDI samples containing specific preselected defects. To interpret the experimental data, we develop a displacement-gradient-based analysis for multireflection BCDI. This allows accurate recovery of the full lattice strain tensor from samples containing multiple dislocations. These capabilities open the door to BCDI as a microscopy tool for studying complex real-world materials.},

abstract = {Nanoscale structures can be highly strained because of confinement effects and the strong influence of their external boundaries. This results in dramatically different electronic, magnetic and optical material properties of considerable utility. Third-generation synchrotron-based coherent X-ray diffraction has emerged as a non-destructive tool for three-dimensional(3D) imaging of strain and defects in crystals that are smaller than the coherence volume, typically a few cubic micrometres, of the available beams that have sufficient flux to reveal the materials structure1. Until now, measurements have been possible only at a single Bragg point of a given crystal beause of the limited ability to maintain alignment2; it has therefore been possible to determine only one component of displacement and not the full strain tensor. Here we report key advances in our fabrication and experimental techniques, which have enabled diffraction patterns to be obtained from six Bragg reflections of the same ZnO nanocrystal for the first time. All three Cartesian components of the ion displacement field, and in turn the full nine-component strain tensor, have thereby been imaged in three dimensions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Coherent X-ray diffraction imaging is a rapidly advancing form of microscopy: diffraction patterns, measured using the latest third-generation synchrotron radiation sources, can be inverted to obtain full three-dimensional images of the interior density within nanocrystals. Diffraction from an ideal crystal lattice results in an identical copy of this continuous diffraction pattern at every Bragg peak. This symmetry is broken by the presence of strain fields, which arise from the epitaxial contact forces that are inevitable whenever nanocrystals are prepared on a substrate. When strain is present, the diffraction copies at different Bragg peaks are no longer identical and contain additional information, appearing as broken local inversion symmetry about each Bragg point. Here we show that one such pattern can nevertheless be inverted to obtain a 'complex' crystal density, whose phase encodes a projection of the lattice deformation. A lead nanocrystal was crystallized in ultrahigh vacuum from a droplet on a silica substrate and equilibrated close to its melting point. A three-dimensional image of the density, obtained by inversion of the coherent X-ray diffraction, shows the expected facetted morphology, but in addition reveals a real-space phase that is consistent with the three-dimensional evolution of a deformation field arising from interfacial contact forces. Quantitative three-dimensional imaging of lattice strain on the nanometre scale will have profound consequences for our fundamental understanding of grain interactions and defects in crystalline materials. Our method of measuring and inverting diffraction patterns from nanocrystals represents a vital step towards the ultimate goal of atomic resolution single-molecule imaging that is a prominent justification for development of X-ray free-electron lasers. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

@article{Cherukara2018,
abstract = {Phase retrieval, or the process of recovering phase information in reciprocal space to reconstruct images from measured intensity alone, is the underlying basis to a variety of imaging applications including coherent diffraction imaging (CDI). Typical phase retrieval algorithms are iterative in nature, and hence, are time-consuming and computationally expensive, making real-time imaging a challenge. Furthermore, iterative phase retrieval algorithms struggle to converge to the correct solution especially in the presence of strong phase structures. In this work, we demonstrate the training and testing of CDI NN, a pair of deep deconvolutional networks trained to predict structure and phase in real space of a 2D object from its corresponding far-field diffraction intensities alone. Once trained, CDI NN can invert a diffraction pattern to an image within a few milliseconds of compute time on a standard desktop machine, opening the door to real-time imaging.},

abstract = {We report a method for using battery electrode materials to directly and continuously control the lattice strain of platinum (Pt) catalyst and thus tune its catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Whereas the common approach of using metal overlayers introduces ligand effects in addition to strain, by electrochemically switching between the charging and discharging status of battery electrodes the change in volume can be precisely controlled to induce either compressive or tensile strain on supported catalysts. Lattice compression and tension induced by the lithium cobalt oxide substrate of ∼5% were directly observed in individual Pt nanoparticles with aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy. We observed 90% enhancement or 40% suppression in Pt ORR activity under compression or tension, respectively, which is consistent with theoretical predictions.},

abstract = {The reconstruction of a single-particle image from the modulus of its Fourier transform, by phase-retrieval methods, has been extensively applied in X-ray structural science. Particularly for strong-phase objects, such as the phase domains found inside crystals by Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI), conventional iteration methods are time consuming and sensitive to their initial guess because of their iterative nature. Here, a deep-neural-network model is presented which gives a fast and accurate estimate of the complex single-particle image in the form of a universal approximator learned from synthetic data. A way to combine the deep-neural-network model with conventional iterative methods is then presented to refine the accuracy of the reconstructed results from the proposed deep-neural-network model. Improved convergence is also demonstrated with experimental BCDI data.},
