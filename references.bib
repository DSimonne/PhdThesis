abstract = {The ammonia oxidation reaction on supported polycrystalline platinum catalyst was investigated in an aluminum-based microreactor. An extensive set of reactions was included in the chemical reactor modeling to facilitate the construction of a kinetic model capable of satisfactory predictions for a wide range of conditions (NH3 partial pressure, 0.01-0.12atm; O2 partial pressure, 0.10-0.88atm; temperature, 523-673K; contact time, 0.3-0.7ms). The elementary surface reactions used in developing the mechanism were chosen based on the literature data concerning ammonia oxidation on a Pt catalyst. Parameter estimates for the kinetic model were obtained using multi-response least squares regression analysis using the isothermal plug-flow reactor approximation. To evaluate the model, the behavior of a microstructured reactor was simulated by means of a complete Navier-Stokes model accounting for the reactions on the catalyst surface and the effect of temperature on the physico-chemical properties of the reacting mixture. In this way, the effect of the catalytic wall temperature non-uniformity and the effect of a boundary layer on the ammonia conversion and selectivity were examined. After further optimization of appropriate kinetic parameters, the calculated selectivities and product yields agree very well with the values actually measured in the microreactor. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This chapter examines how atoms are arranged in main engineering solids. Many engineering materials (almost all metals and ceramics, for instance) are made up entirely of small crystals or grains in which atoms are packed in regular, repeating, three-dimensional patterns; the grains are stuck together meeting at grain boundaries. This chapter focuses on the individual crystals that can be best understood by thinking of the atoms as hard spheres. The chapter also discusses close-packed structures and crystal energies followed by crystallography, plane indices, and direction indices. The chapter concludes with a discussion of atom packing in polymers, atom packing in inorganic glasses, and the density of solids.}

abstract = {The adsorption of thermally cracked atomic oxygen on the Pt(111) surface has been investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), co-axial impact collision ion scattering spectroscopy (CAICISS), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED). High concentrations of atomic oxygen (∼2×1015 atomscm−2) can be cleanly adsorbed on the Pt(111) surface at room temperature by dosing the surface with externally generated atomic oxygen at relatively low exposures (∼50 L). Two states of oxygen are readily resolved by XPS with O1s binding energies at 530.8 and 530.2 eV. These states are assigned to chemisorbed oxygen and to an oxidic oxygen state, respectively. XPS spectra of the Pt4f region confirm the existence of an oxide species with the appearance of a peak at 2.4 eV higher binding energy than the bulk Pt 4f5/2 peak. Using a combination of angle-resolved XPS, CAICISS, and LEED, evidence is provided to suggest that penetration of oxygen into the surface occurs most likely by an exchange mechanism resulting in the reconstruction of the Pt atoms in the first two atomic layers. On annealing the oxygen covered surface at 500 °C the oxidic layer is observed to decompose and a p(2×2)-O reconstruction is observed. A CAICISS study of this reconstructed surface presents evidence in favour of O atoms occupying h.c.p. sites over f.c.c. sites. Low exposures (∼5 L) of atomic oxygen result in a sharp p(2×2) reconstruction of the Pt(111) surface and a single species in the O1s spectrum at a binding energy of 530.8 eV. Both the p(2×2)-O overlayer and the oxide species are shown to be extremely sensitive to the electron and ion beam.}

abstract = {The oxidation of Pt(111) by gas-phase oxygen atoms was investigated in ultrahigh vacuum using temperature programmed desorption (TPD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron energy loss spectroscopy (ELS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED). Atomic oxygen coverages as high as 2.9ML (monolayers) could be generated on Pt(111) using an atomic oxygen beam, and both the adsorption of oxygen atoms and the progression of surface oxygen phases with increasing atomic oxygen coverage are found to be relatively insensitive to the surface temperature over the range from 250 to 450K. The results show that oxidation involves the development of a chemisorbed layer for oxygen coverages up to about 0.75ML, and that the average binding energy of an oxygen atom chemisorbed on Pt(111) decreases significantly (∼100kJ/mol) with increasing oxygen coverage, in agreement with previous observations [D.H. Parker, M.E. Bartram, B.E. Koel, Surf. Sci. 217 (1989) 489, N.A. Saliba, Y.-L. Tsai, C. Panja, B.E. Koel, Surf. Sci. 419 (1999) 79]. Long-range order in the chemisorbed layer generally diminishes as the oxygen coverage increases above the 0.25ML saturation coverage of the p(2×2) layer, though the persistence of a (2×2) LEED pattern up to about 0.50ML is consistent with the formation of domains of a new, high-density ordered phase. Disordering within the chemisorbed layer becomes more pronounced with continued atomic oxygen adsorption to coverages greater than 0.50ML. Distinct features in the O2 thermal desorption traces at 650K and 560K are attributed to the desorption of oxygen from a high-density ordered phase and disordered domains, respectively, which suggests that the binding energy is lowest for oxygen atoms chemisorbed in the disordered domains. Increasing the atomic oxygen coverage above approximately 0.75ML is shown to result in the growth of Pt oxide particles and disordering of the Pt surface. Decomposition of the Pt oxide particles produces explosive desorption of O2 that is characterized by a shift of the desorption peak to higher temperature and a dramatic increase in the maximum desorption rate with increasing oxygen coverage. The main characteristics of the explosive desorption are well reproduced by a kinetic model in which oxygen atoms are assumed to migrate from oxide domains onto regions of the surface containing chemisorbed oxygen atoms, and with oxygen atoms desorbing only from the chemisorbed layer. The implication of this mechanism is that Pt oxide is more thermodynamically favorable than high concentrations of chemisorbed oxygen atoms on Pt(111), and hence that the growth of Pt oxide on Pt(111) is kinetically limited.}

abstract = {Ozone (O3) is a reactive oxidant, creating high effective oxygen pressures under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. Large oxygen concentrations up to ΘO=2.4ML were produced by ozone exposure on Pt(111) at 300K and analyzed using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED). O2 desorption occurs in broad TPD peaks that shift from 814 to 558K as the oxygen coverage increases from 0.03 to 0.95ML. For coverages of ΘO≥1.2ML, “undercutting” of the desorption curves occurs, along with a narrowing and shift to higher temperature, such that O2 desorption occurs in a sharp (23K wide) peak at 708K at ΘO=2.4ML. LEED shows a (2×2) pattern for ΘO near 0.25ML, but then only a (1×1) pattern between 0.3 and 1.2ML. For oxygen coverages larger than 1.2ML, the Pt(111) surface is disordered. Using the leading edge method, we estimate that the desorption activation energy decreases from 45 to 20kcalmol−1 with increased oxygen concentration for 0<ΘO<1.2ML, and thereafter increases with increasing concentration to 38kcalmol−1 at ΘO=2.4ML. We interpret the O2 desorption curves for ΘO>1.2ML as arising from decomposition of particles of platinum oxide of increasing size near the surface. A very weakly bound state of oxygen also exists at high ΘO and desorbs at 390K. Oxidized platinum is reduced upon heating to Pt metal in the temperature range of 674–708K in UHV.}

Raman spectra of alpha‐PtO2 films show two sharp lines at 514 and 560 cm−1, in agreement with those from commercially available powders.

Infrared reflectivity spectra yield two of the three ir‐active phonons, and along with scanning tunneling microscopy measurements suggest that PtO is a semiconductor.

The instrument facilitates studies of the near-surface chemical composition, electronic and geometric structure of a variety of samples using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near-edge X-ray absorption fine-structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy in the photon energy range from 170eV to 2800eV.

By operating the optical elements in a low-pressure oxygen atmosphere, carbon contamination can be almost completely eliminated, which makes the beamline particularly suitable for carbon {\it K}-edge NEXAFS. The endstation can be operated at pressures up to 100mbar, whereby XPS can be routinely performed up to 30mbar. A selection of typical data demonstrates the capability of the instrument to analyse details of the surface composition of solid samples under ambient-pressure conditions using XPS and NEXAFS. In addition, it offers a convenient way of analysing the gas phase through X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Short XPS spectra can be measured at a time scale of tens of seconds. The shortest data acquisition times for NEXAFS are around 0.5s per data point.},

The derivations are valid for any incoming or outgoing angle of the X-ray beam, and are particularly important for measurements at large perpendicular momentum transfer. Expressions are derived for the integrated intensity from rocking scans, from stationary measurements and from reflectivity data. With all correction factors known, it is possible to derive the structure factors with a common scale factor from all these types of scans.

A variety of structures is observed by LEED: Ir(100) exhibits a relatively simple (1 × 5) pattern; Pt(100) shows a series of closely related patterns, a typical representative of which has a (141−15) structure; Au(100) usually exhibits a c(26 × 68) pattern, often inaccurately described in the literature as a (20 × 5) pattern. The reconstruction of Au(111) is also considered for comparison. Various plausible structural models are discussed, while laser simulation is used to lessen the number of these models. The analysis is completed in a companion paper where LEED intensity calculations are reported to determine the atomic locations.}

(i) For a clean surface, the results were obtained by employing the standard restricted-solid-on-solid (RSOS) model with surface diffusion occurring via jumps to nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor sites. The kinetics of surface roughening at T\\&gt;TR and of surface relaxation at T\\&lt;TR are found to be logarithmic in time. In particular, the mean-square height difference at T\\&gt;TR increases with time as w2∝ln t. (ii) Complementing the RSOS model by terms describing adsorption, we demonstrate that adsorbate-induced surface roughening may occur with significant lowering of TR, due, respectively, to indirect next-nearest-neighbor adsorbate–substrate repulsion, attractive nearest- neighbor adsorbate–substrate lateral interaction, and/or repulsive adsorbate-adsorbate lateral interaction. In all these cases, the ratio of TRnear adsorbate saturation and for the clean surface, respectively, is given by an analytical expression that is a simple combination of the corresponding interactions. The coverage dependence of TR in MC simulations is nonlinear and slightly different compared to the mean-field-type prediction. (iii) The effect of adsorbate-induced roughening on a catalytic reaction can be dramatic even at weak roughening, with qualitative and quantitative changes in the kinetics. For example, the absolute conversion rate at maximum rate, and the reactant mixture corresponding to this maximum can be very different on the flat and roughened surface. The behavior of the adsorbate coverages near the points corresponding to the kinetic phase transitions can change character qualitatively.}",

Subsequently, undesirable by-products of ion bombardment, such as surface damage, particle implantation and preferential sputtering are considered. A concise experimental section deals with ion beam and glow discharge techniques applied for surface cleaning as well as with some surface analytical methods (Auger electron spectroscopy, low-energy ion scattering, secondary ion mass spectroscopy) which are useful and necessary to check the obtained cleaning effect.

abstract = {Catalytic ammonia oxidation over platinum has been studied experimentally from UHV up to atmospheric pressure with polycrystalline Pt and with the Pt single crystal orientations (533), (443), (865), and (100). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations explored the reaction pathways on Pt(111) and Pt(211). It was shown, both in theory and experimentally, that ammonia is activated by adsorbed oxygen, i.e. by Oad or by OHad. In situ XPS up to 1 mbar showed the existence of NHx (x = 0,1,2,3) intermediates on Pt(533). Based on a mechanism of ammonia activation via the interaction with Oad/OHad a detailed and a simplified mathematical model were formulated which reproduced the experimental data semiquantitatively. From transient experiments in vacuum performed in a transient analysis of products (TAP) reactor it was concluded that N2O is formed by recombination of two NOad species and by a reaction between NOad and NHx,ad (x = 0,1,2) fragments. Reaction-induced morphological changes were studied with polycrystalline Pt in the mbar range and with stepped Pt single crystals as model systems in the range 10-5-10-1 mbar. {\textcopyright} the Owner Societies.},

Solid catalysts are highly complex, porous, multi-elemental and often hierarchically structured materials. Scientists are therefore confronted with a formidable challenge to understand the functioning of solid catalysts and, based on this knowledge, to design and make materials with superior performance and overall stability. In this Review, we summarize the latest developments in the spatial and temporal characterization of solid catalysts using synchrotron radiation to uncover their structure and function. Attention is focused on applications using either X-rays or infrared light available from synchrotron radiation sources. In these applications, microscopy and microspectroscopy are used to study heterogeneous catalysts under working conditions and at different length scales, more specifically, from the level of a microreactor down to a single catalyst particle. Finally, we offer a perspective on what instrumental developments at synchrotron radiation sources may bring to realize the dream of recording a molecular movie of a solid catalyst at high temperature and pressure.},

In the area of materials science and computational heterogeneous catalysis, this revolution has led to the development of scientific data repositories, as well as data mining and machine learning tools to investigate the vast materials space. The goal of using these tools is to establish a deeper understanding of the relations between materials properties and activity, selectivity and stability – the important figures of merit in catalysis. Based on these insights, catalyst design principles can be established, which hopefully lead us to discover highly efficient catalysts to solve pressing issues for a sustainable future and the synthesis of highly functional materials, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The inherent complexity of catalytic reactions quests for machine learning methods to efficiently navigate through the high-dimensional hyper-surfaces in structure optimization problems to determine relevant chemical structures and transition states. In this review, we show how cutting edge data infrastructures and machine learning methods are being used to address problems in computational heterogeneous catalysis.},

In addition, LEED simulations based on a Moir{\'{e}} approach have been applied. Annealing temperatures around 850 °C yield a superstructure that approaches a commensurable c(26.6×118) substrate registry. It evolves from a Moir{\'{e}}-like buckling of a compressed hexagonal top layer (hex) where atomic rows of the hex run parallel to atomic rows of the square substrate. Annealing at 920 °C stimulates a continuous rotation of the hex where all angles between ±0.7° are simultaneously realized. At temperatures around 1080 °C, the nonrotated hex coexists with a hex that is rotated by about 0.75°. Annealing at temperatures around 1120 °C yield a locking of the hex in fixed rotation angles of 0.77°, 0.88°, and 0.94°.

The total surface area was measured by physical adsorption of Kr (Kr-BET). The surface area of used samples varied between 0.01 and 0.06 m2/g representing an increase in surface area of 2 to 20 times compared with the surface area of new catalysts. A gauze with Rh2O3whiskers exhibited the largest increase in surface area. Except for this abnormal sample, the top gauze in the catalyst pack exhibited the largest surface area. The active surface area of the Pt–Rh gauze catalysts was measured by H2-titration/adsorption. It was assumed that Pt represents the active part of the catalyst. When exposing a spent gauze to H2at 298 K, only platinum oxide on the catalyst surface was titrated. During operation the catalyst deactivates partly by the formation of Rh2O3, which was found to be inert against H2at 298 K. However, reduction of used catalyst gauze in H2at 623 K and reoxidation at 623 K made all the Rh2O3reactive toward H2at 298 K, indicating the presence of two forms of Rh2O3. It was observed that only the first gauze in a gauze pack from a NH3-oxidation reactor comprised a noteworthy active area. All the other gauzes investigated were more or less blocked by Rh2O3.}

abstract = {The structure of the Pt(100)-hex-R0.7° reconstructed phase has been studied by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The hexagonal first layer superstructure of this surface, written in matrix notation as N 1 -1 5, N = 12-14, was imaged with atomic resolution. The fivefold periodicity of this reconstruction was confirmed. The coexistence of differently oriented hexagonal domains on a single terrace was observed. Steps along the longer corrugation length of the surface reconstruction were found, on the average, to follow the [N 1] direction of the hexagonal Pt overlayer rather than any low-index direction of the square substrate. The transition from the N 1 -1 5 reconstruction to the Pt(100)-(1 × 1) surface structure due to exposure to CO and O2 was found to be initiated by heterogeneous nucleation, the nucleation centers being step edges and structural irregularities disrupting the hexagonal structure along a direction close to the hexagonal [1̄ 5] direction. The growth of the (1 × 1) phase was highly anisotropic, i.e. the growth being much faster along the [01̄1] direction (the substrate direction closer to the [N 1] direction of the hexagonal layer) than along the [011] direction. A higher density of atoms in the hexagonal than in the (1 × 1) surface layer causes islands, a single Pt(100) lattice spacing high, to form during the structural transformation. These islands were found to be a mixture of isotropic islands with diameter 10-15 {\AA} and islands highly elongated along the faster growth direction of the (1 × 1) phase. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {Deactivation of 2.0-15 nm Pt crystallites supported on alumina and Pt black was studied in a fixed-bed differential reactor during NH3 oxidation by molecular oxygen between 368 and 473 °K. Marked deactivation caused by surface oxidation took place during the first 12 hr on stream. Deactivation occurred only in the presence of both reactants. It was more severe with smaller crystallites and at lower temperatures. The rate decay was best described by a second-order deactivation process. At 433 °K oxygen present in the deactivated 2.7 nm crystallites was about 5 atoms per surface Pt atom, giving an estimated bulk composition of PtO1.7. For the 15.5 nm crystallites the oxygen present in the deactivated crystallites was about 7 atoms per surface Pt atom but the resultant bulk composition was PtO0.5. Deactivation was reversible and activity could be restored by raising the temperature above 473 °K or by reacting with H2 or NH3. Deactivated catalyst slowly released oxygen in reaction with NH3 chemisorbed on the support after the feed O2 and NH3 were turned off. This is a form of reverse spillover. Platinum black studies confirmed the results with the supported catalysts. {\textcopyright} 1976.},

However, experimental investigations of platinum surface oxides have been hampered by technical limitations, preventing in situ investigations at relevant pressures. As a result, the time-dependent evolution of oxide formation has only received superficial treatment. In addition, the amorphous structures of many surface oxides have hindered realistic theoretical studies. Using near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) we show that a time scale of hours (t≥4 h) is required for the formation of platinum surface oxides.

abstract = {We investigated the kinetics governing the transition from surface (2D) to bulk (3D) oxide growth on Pt(1 0 0) in ultrahigh vacuum as a function of the surface temperature and the incident flux of an oxygen atom beam. For the incident fluxes examined, the bulk oxide formation rate increases linearly with incident flux ($\Phi$O) as the oxygen coverage increases to about 1.7 ML (monolayer) and depends only weakly on the surface temperature in the limit of low surface temperature (TS < 475 K). In contrast, in the high temperature limit (TS > 525 K), the bulk oxide formation rate increases with $\Phi$O2 for oxygen coverages as high as 1.6 ML, and decreases with increasing surface temperature. We show that the measured kinetics is quantitatively reproduced by a model which assumes that O atoms adsorb on top of the 2D oxide, and that this species acts as a precursor that can either associatively desorb or react with the 2D oxide to form a 3D oxide particle. According to the model, the observed change in the flux and surface temperature dependence of the oxidation rate is due to a change in the rate-controlling steps for bulk oxide formation from reaction at low temperature to precursor desorption at high temperature. From analysis of flux-dependent uptake data, we estimate that the formation rate of a bulk oxide nucleus has a fourth-order dependence on the precursor coverage, which implies a critical configuration for oxide nucleus formation requiring four precursor O atoms. Considering the similarities in the development of surface oxides on various transition metals, the precursor-mediated transition to bulk oxide growth reported here may be a general feature in the oxidation of late transition metal surfaces. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

On a CO-covered Pt(100) surface, we prepared oxygen islands which appear dark in the PEEM image due to their higher work function. As the surface is heated to temperatures above 650 K we observe the conversion of these dark islands into very bright ones with work functions much lower than even that of the clean surface arising from an inverted dipole moment of oxygen atoms beneath the surface. We found an activation energy for this conversion of about 15 kcal/mol. Partially transformed oxygen islands were used to study the reactivity and the formation of this species further. CO and H2 both react with subsurface oxygen rather slowly, while at the interface between the subsurface and the chemisorbed phase, both adsorbents accelerate the conversion of parts of the remaining oxygen atoms towards the subsurface state. In contrast, additional oxygen adsorption does not contribute to a further transformation. We propose a qualitative microscopic model for the formation of subsurface oxygen based on experimental evidence.}

The NH dissociation reaction is promoted on Pt{100} but not on Pt{211}. The NH2 dissociation reaction is neither promoted by Pt{100} nor Pt{211}. The dissociation of NH3 is also not promoted and turns out to be a two-step reaction on the platinum surfaces. Atop-bonded NH2 is intermediate and equally stable on the three surfaces. The nature of the transition states, which is late in the formation and early in the rearrangement of this atop-bonded NH2, makes the barriers almost independent of the surface topology.

abstract = {The development of improved Ammonia Slip Catalysts (ASCs) was pursued by changing the composition and architecture of the critical functions, Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) and oxidation, needed in the catalyst for high NH 3 oxidation activity and selectivity to N2. Selected space velocities and reactant compositions were used to probe chemical and physical processes that limit the performance of ASCs. On a single component Pt/Al 2O3 catalyst, at the lower space velocity (66k h -1) light-off was characterized by a sharp increase in NH3 conversion to >98\%, while at high space velocity (265k h-1) the transition in conversion was more gradual and the limiting conversion was below 98\%, indicative of transverse transport limitations. The light-off temperature of ammonia oxidation on Pt/Al2O3 catalyst decreased with Pt loading from 0.7 to 10 g Pt/ft3 monolith and, in general, the selectivity to N2 decreased while that of N2O and NO x increased. A dual-layer ASC comprising a top layer of Fe-ZSM-5 and a bottom layer of Pt/Al2O3 resulted in higher selectivity and yield to N2, due to SCR reactions between the counter diffusing NOx formed in the Pt/Al2O3 and NH3 reactant in the Fe-zeolite layer. However, the diffusion resistance provided by the Fe-ZSM-5 layer inhibited the overall ammonia conversion at high space velocity. When Fe-zeolite and Pt/Al2O3 particles were mixed and washcoated as a single layer, this led to an increase in NH 3 conversion at high space velocity due to a decrease in the diffusion barrier that was observed with the dual-layer structure. When SCR and oxidation catalyst particles were contiguous in the washcoat structure as in single-layer mixed catalysts, the N2 yield was lower due to Pt-catalyzed NH3 oxidation, compared to the dual-layer ASC, which was especially apparent at low space velocity. The dual-layer catalyst was superior to the mixed layer catalyst at high temperatures, exhibiting lower NO x and higher N2 yields whereas the mixed catalyst out-performed the dual-layer catalyst at low temperature by exhibiting lower N2O and higher N2 yield. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Platinum-group metals and noble metals play an important role in catalysis, for total oxidation as well as for partial oxidation reactions. Only in recent years have advances in microscopic, spectroscopic and computer simulation techniques made it possible to investigate the interaction of oxygen with metallic substrates at an atomistic level. We present an overview on the formation of adsorption structures and surface oxides on Rh, Pd, Ag, Cu and Pt surfaces, with particular focus on the phase diagrams calculated from first-principles thermodynamics. The low-index (111), (100) and (110) surfaces as well as selected high-index surfaces have been considered. We predict the stability of novel structures such as the c(4 × 6) on Cu(100) and the alpha-PtO2  trilayer on Pt(100). The knowledge of the Gibbs free surface energies allows us to predict the adsorbate-induced changes in the thermodynamic equilibrium shape of metal nanoparticles. At low oxygen chemical potential, corresponding to clean surfaces, the (111) facets dominate the particle shape, with a significant contribution from (100) facets. But even under these conditions a small fraction of the overall surface corresponds to more open facets. As oxygen adsorption sets in, their contribution becomes larger. At high oxygen partial pressures, surface oxides form on the platinum-group metals. They do not only display different chemical properties than the metal, but also determine the exposed surface orientations of the particles. The latter effect might play an important role for the catalytic activity of transition metal nanoparticles.}

Remarkably, some significant questions regarding their structural energies remain even today, specifically for the large-scale quasihexagonally reconstructed (100) surfaces: rather dissimilar reconstruction energies for Au and Pt in available experiments and experiment and theory do not match for Pt. We here show by all-electron density functional theory that only large enough " (5×N) " approximant supercells capture the qualitative reconstruction energy trend between Au(100) and Pt(100), in contrast to what is often done in the theoretical literature. Their magnitudes are then in fact similar and closer to the measured value for Pt(100); our calculations achieve excellent agreement with known geometric characteristics and provide direct evidence for the electronic reconstruction driving force. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

If a CO covered Pt(100) surface is exposed to oxygen patches are formed which appear dark in the PEEM image due to their high work function. As the surface is heated to temperatures above 650 K we observe the conversion of these dark islands into very bright ones with work functions much lower than even that of the clean surface. These findings are attributed to a change in the dipole moment of the adsorbed oxygen induced by their migration beneath the surface. A total work-function decrease of up to 1.2 eV has been evaluated independently using a Scanning Photoemission Microscope (SPM). The properties of this new kind of oxygen were also further investigated with thermal desorption spectroscopy and with Auger-electron spectroscopy.},

abstract = {To understand the "pressure and material gap" in the platinum-catalyzed ammonia oxidation over Pt, the reaction was studied over a wide range of pressures (10-3-105 Pa) and temperatures (293-1073 K) with different Pt catalysts: stepped Pt(533) single crystal, knitted Pt gauze, and Pt foil. Experiments were supplemented by theory applying DFT calculations. It was concluded that the primary reaction step of NH3 oxidation, stripping of hydrogen from the NH3 molecule, is favored by the presence of surface O and OH species. The latter species are more active for dehydrogenation of NH2 and NH fragments. NO and N2 are the only nitrogen-containing products detected under UHV conditions (p<10-1 Pa). N2O was observed, however, at about 6 Pa (peak pressure) in the temporal analysis of products (TAP) reactor and under ambient pressure conditions of 100 kPa in a microstructured reactor. The pressure dependence of N2O formation is suggested to be related to a minimum surface coverage by reaction intermediates required for N2O formation, which is a real "pressure gap" phenomenon. Independently of the pressure range (10-3-105 Pa) and the type of Pt specimen, N2 formation prevails at low temperatures (<700 K), whereas NO production increases with temperature and becomes the dominant reaction channel at high temperature. Catalyst characterization by SEM revealed a reconstruction of the Pt surface after ammonia oxidation at ambient pressure. The degree of surface restructuring is related to the total exposure of the catalyst to the reactants. Surface roughening contributes to activation of the catalyst and changes in its selectivity. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We present calculated adsorption energies of oxygen on gold and platinum clusters with up to 923 atoms (3 nm diameter) using density functional theory. We find that surface tension of the clusters induces a compression, which weakens the bonding of adsorbates compared with the bonding on extended surfaces. The effect is largest for close-packed surfaces and almost nonexistent on the more reactive steps and edges. The effect is largest at low coverage and decreases, even changing sign, at higher coverages where the strain changes from compressive to tensile. Quantum size effects also influence adsorption energies but only below a critical size of 1.5 nm for platinum and 2.5 nm for gold. We develop a model to describe the strain-induced size effects on adsorption energies, which is able to describe the influence of surface structure, adsorbate, metal, and coverage.},

First, an approach taking into account the evolution of the diffracting area during an {$\omega$} scan is presented. From the calculation of the effective part of the sample surface that participates in the diffraction phenomena at each step of the scan, a more accurate correction factor than those commonly used is derived and the evolution of the line shape along a zero-width rod is explained. Secondly, the case of finite-width rods, under the point-like sample approximation, is considered: the influence of the partial integration, as a result of the detector in-plane acceptance, of a rod with an anisotropic in-plane shape, is studied and leads to an analytical expression for the corresponding correction factor. Finally, a full numerical simulation is presented, which provides an alternative method for correcting the experimental intensities and shows in which conditions the previous formulae are no longer valid.},

abstract = {The mechanism and kinetics of NH 3 decomposition reaction mechanism has been a subject of interest for decades, although it is attracting renewed interest in connection with hydrogen generation for fuel cells. This system represents an example of a most peculiar nonlinear catalytic reaction sequence for which, even though the mechanistic steps are well-accepted and their DFT energetics widely studied, the microkinetics have not yet been fully investigated. In fact, there is no agreement even as to which step(s) are rate-limiting. Employing our Reaction Route (RR) Graph approach and the corresponding electrical analogy, we investigate in detail the steady-state microkinetics of the seven-step NH 3 decomposition reaction mechanism. Based on an Ohm's law representation of kinetics, we develop an accurate quasi steady-state (QSS) rate expression for the complete sequence, not possible with the usual QSS approach, which provides only numerical results for the nonlinear sequence. Further, it allows the rate-limiting step(s) to be identified in a rigorous manner, based simply on a comparison of the step resistances. Combining this with identification of the most abundant reactive intermediate (MARI), the mechanism and the rate expressions are pruned to provide a simplified rate law that is found to be in complete agreement with numerical QSS analysis as well as with our experimental data on Fe without any fitted parameters. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The epitaxial Pt oxide layer is oriented hexagon on hexagon with respect to the Pt(111) surface leading to a (8 × 8) superstructure surface unit cell. In a second set of experiments, a 100 thick epitaxial Pt(111) film on sapphire was exposed to oxygen. At 670K and near atmospheric oxygen pressures we find the formation of a several angstrom thick oxide layer. After annealing the sample at 720K in a vacuum the oxide layer desorbs, recovering the 100 thick Pt film. Subsequent oxidation at 720K and reduction cycles lead to a slight increase in surface roughness and the formation of macroscopically visible holes in the Pt film.

abstract = {The structure transition Pt(100) 1 × 1 → hex is observed by means of LEED intensities. The clean metastable 1 × 1 phase is prepared by intermediate NO adsorption. The transition to the hexagonal surface structure, which is an activated process, is initiated by raising the temperature. Integral intensities for both integer order spots as well as for superstructure spots are taken as function of time for constant elevated temperatures and as function of temperature for continuous temperature increase. The development of spot profiles is recorded as well. It turns out that the spot half width of integer order spots remains constant during the transition. Intermediate stages during the structure change show considerable background which is concentrated to streaks and indicates structural disorder. The superstructure spots grow up from the streaks giving first a 1 × 5 pattern from which the final structure results by spot splitting in the very last stage of the transition. Their intensity increase is delayed with respect to the decrease of integer order spots. They occur already with a comparably narrow half width, which remains constant in a first part of the transition. In the second part, especially during the final splitting, a further reduction is observed. The results are qualitatively discussed to give a geometrical model of the reconstruction based on the shift of atomic rows. Quantitative evaluation of the intensity-time dependences results in the activation energy of the transition, $\Delta$E≈1.1 eV. From the temperature dependent measurements the surface Debye temperatures of the 1 × 1 and reconstructed phases are deduced to be roughly equal. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

The formation of subsurface oxygen has been reported previously on Pt(1 0 0) during CO oxidation at low pressures (<1 × 10-4 Torr). This communication reports the formation of subsurface oxygen at intermediate pressures (∼0.1 Torr). These observations show that subsurface oxygen plays a role in catalytic CO oxidation and pattern formation, which has implications for catalysts operated at higher pressures. New microkinetic models of CO oxidation that incorporate subsurface oxygen are discussed. Results of these models are qualitatively similar to experimental observations of subsurface oxygen, confirming the importance of this species in the reaction dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {The introduction of in situ techniques has had a vast impact on research and development in the area of heterogeneous catalysis as emphasized in many reviews and monographs. Recently, the number of in situ techniques that can give information at the atomic scale has increased significantly and new possibilities exist for making the measurements under industrially relevant conditions. In order to fully exploit the results from the in situ and operando studies, it has also become increasingly gainful to combine the experimental studies with theoretical methodologies based on, for example, Density Functional Theory (DFT). This has allowed one to extract more detailed atomic-scale information from the measurements and it has also allowed the establishment of detailed structure-activity relationships. Furthermore, the interplay between in situ techniques and theory has helped bridging the pressure gap such that in situ information obtained at conditions far from industrial ones may be used in a more relevant manner. Here, we will illustrate how microscopy-, spectroscopy- and X-ray-based techniques in combination with experimental and theoretical surface science methods can aid industrial catalyst developments.

@article{Barteau1981,
abstract = {The kinetics of the CO oxidation reaction were examined on the Pt(100)-(5 × 20) surface under UHV conditions. The transient isothermal rate of CO2 production was examined both for exposure of an oxygen-dosed surface to a beam of CO and for exposure of a CO-dosed surface to a beam of O2. Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics were found to apply in both cases. For the reaction of CO with preadsorbed oxygen atoms, the reaction rate was dependent upon the square-root of the oxygen atom coverage, suggesting that oxygen atoms were adsorbed in islands on this surface. The oxidation of preadsorbed CO was observed only when the initial CO concentrations were less than 0.5 monolayer (c(2 × 2) structure), suggesting that the dissociative adsorption of oxygen required adjacent four-fold surface sites. The activation energy calculated for the reaction of CO with preadsorbed oxygen was 31.4 kcal/mol. This value was 30 kcal/mol greater than the activation energy measured for the reaction of O2 with preadsorbed CO. Strong attractive interactions within the oxygen islands were at least partially responsible for this difference. The reaction kinetics in both cases changed dramatically below 300 K; this change is believed to be due to phase separation at the lower temperature. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

abstract = {Current best-practice lithographic techniques are unable to meet the functional requirements needed to enable on-chip plasmonic devices capable of fully exploiting nanostructure properties reliant on a tailored nanostructure size, composition, architecture, crystallinity, and placement. As a consequence, numerous nanofabrication methods have emerged that address various weaknesses, but none have, as of yet, demonstrated a large-area processing route capable of defining organized surfaces of nanostructures with the architectural diversity and complexity that is routinely displayed in colloidal syntheses. Here, a hybrid fabrication strategy is demonstrated in which nanoimprint lithography is combined with templated dewetting and liquid-phase syntheses that is able to realize periodic arrays of complex noble metal nanostructures over square centimeter areas. The process is inexpensive, can be carried out on a benchtop, and requires modest levels of instrumentation. Demonstrated are three fabrication schemes yielding arrays of core-shell, core-void-shell, and core-void-nanoframe structures using liquid-phase syntheses involving heteroepitaxial deposition, galvanic replacement, and dealloying. With the field of nanotechnology being increasingly reliant on the engineering of desirable physicochemical responses through architectural control, the fabrication strategy provides a platform for advancing devices reliant on addressable arrays or the collective response from an ensemble of identical nanostructures.},

Surface energy and related catalytic mechanisms are widely studied. However, the catalyst lattice deformation induced by catalytic processes is not well understood. Here, we study the strain in an individual platinum (Pt) nanoparticle (NP) using Bragg coherent diffraction imaging under in situ oxidation and reduction reactions. When Pt NPs are exposed to H2O2, a typical oxidizer and an intermediate during the oxygen reduction reaction process, alternating overall strain distribution near the surface and inside the NP is observed at the (111) Bragg reflection. In contrast, relatively insignificant changes appear in the (200) reflection. Density functional theory calculations are employed to rationalize the anisotropic lattice strain in terms of induced stress by H2O2 adsorption and decomposition on the Pt NP surface. Our study provides deeper insight into the activity-structure relationship in this system.},

It is shown that this stable phase differs from the first one by a slight rotation of the hexagonal surface layer by 0.7°. For Ir(100) only the well known (1 × 5) superstructure is observed without any rotation of the outer layer. The rotation angle of 0.7° for platinum and the stability of the unrelated structure for iridium can be interpreted by simple calculations of the coordination of surface atoms with those of the second layer. The method assumes that the surface layer is of ideal hexagonal structure in the case of platinum and nearly hexagonal in the case of iridium. The results are in good agreement with the experiment. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

The technique provides three-dimensional lattice strain fields from which surface reactivity maps can be inferred. However, all experiments published so far have investigated particles an order of magnitude larger than those used in practical applications. Studying smaller particles quickly becomes demanding as the diffracted intensity falls. Here, in situ nanodiffraction data from 60 nm Au nanoparticles under electrochemical control collected at the hard X-ray nanoprobe beamline of MAX IV, NanoMAX, are presented. Two-dimensional image reconstructions of these particles are produced, and it is estimated that NanoMAX, which is now open for general users, has the requisites for three-dimensional imaging of particles of a size relevant for catalytic applications. This represents the first demonstration of coherent X-ray diffraction experiments performed at a diffraction-limited storage ring, and illustrates the importance of these new sources for experiments where coherence properties become crucial.},

Its main advantage is that information about the three-dimensional structure of the object is already contained in a single image. This makes it useful for the reconstruction of fragile and non-reproducible particles without the need for tomographic measurements. However, currently there is no efficient numerical inversion algorithm available that is capable of determining the object's structure in real time. Neural networks, on the other hand, excel in image processing tasks suited for such purpose. Here we show how a physics-informed deep neural network can be used to reconstruct complete three-dimensional object models on a voxel grid from single two-dimensional wide-angle scattering patterns. We demonstrate its universal reconstruction capabilities for silver nanoclusters, where the network uncovers novel geometric structures that reproduce the experimental scattering data with very high precision.},

abstract = {Compton scattering is generally neglected in diffraction experiments because the incoherent radiation it generates does not give rise to interference effects and therefore is negligible at Bragg peaks. However, as the scattering volume is reduced, the difference between the Rayleigh (coherent) and Compton (incoherent) contributions at Bragg peaks diminishes and the incoherent part may become substantial. The consequences can be significant for coherent diffraction imaging at high scattering angles: the incoherent radiation produces background that smears out the secondary interference fringes, affecting thus the achievable resolution of the technique. Here, a criterion that relates the object shape and the resolution is introduced.

In this report, we will introduce the principles of forward scattering CDI and Bragg geometry CDI (BCDI), with an emphasis on the latter. BCDI exploits the ultrahigh sensitivity of the diffraction pattern to the distortions of crystalline lattice. Its ability of imaging strain on the nanometer scale in three dimensions is highly novel.

abstract = {Reconstructing the high-resolution volumetric 3D shape from images is challenging due to the cubic growth of computational cost. In this paper, we propose a Fourier-based method that reconstructs a 3D shape from images in a 2D space by predicting slices in the frequency domain. According to the Fourier slice projection theorem, we introduce a thickness map to bridge the domain gap between images in the spatial domain and slices in the frequency domain. The thickness map is the 2D spatial projection of the 3D shape, which is easily predicted from the input image by a general convolutional neural network. Each slice in the frequency domain is the Fourier transform of the corresponding thickness map. All slices constitute a 3D descriptor and the 3D shape is the inverse Fourier transform of the descriptor. Using slices in the frequency domain, our method can transfer the 3D shape reconstruction from the 3D space into the 2D space, which significantly reduces the computational cost. The experiment results on the ShapeNet dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art reconstruction methods.},

We demonstrate the approach on experimental coherent Bragg diffraction data measured with 52 keV x-rays from a nanocrystalline sample. From this sample, we resolve the fine fringe detail of a high-energy x-ray Bragg coherent diffraction pattern to an upsampling factor of 16 of the native pixel pitch of 30 &#x03BC;m of a charge-integrating fastCCD detector. This was accomplished by analysis of individual photon locations in a series of &#x201C;nearly-dark&#x201D; instances of the diffraction pattern that each contain only a handful of photons. Central to our approach was the adaptation of the UNLOC photon fitting routine for PALM/STORM to the hard x-ray regime to handle much smaller point spread functions, which required a different statistical test for photon detection and for sub-pixel localization. A comparison to a photon-localization strategy used in the x-ray community (&#x201C;droplet analysis&#x201D;) showed that XR-UNLOC provides significant improvement in super-resolution. We also developed a metric by which to estimate the limit of reliable upsampling with XR-UNLOC under a given set of experimental conditions in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio of a photon detection event and the size of the point spread function for guiding future x-ray experiments in many disciplines where detector pixelation limits must be overcome.},

Indeed, at the nanoscale, their functional properties are largely influenced by elastic strain and depend critically on the presence of crystal defects. It is thus of prime importance to be able to monitor, by noninvasive means, the stability of the microstructure of nano-objects against external stimuli such as mechanical load. Here we demonstrate the potential of Bragg coherent diffraction imaging for such measurements, by imaging in 3D the evolution of the microstructure of a nanocrystal exposed to in situ mechanical loading. Not only could we observe the evolution of the internal strain field after successive loadings, but we also evidenced a transient microstructure hosting a stable dislocation loop. The latter is fully characterized from its characteristic displacement field. The mechanical behavior of this small crystal is clearly at odds with what happens in bulk materials where many dislocations interact. Moreover, this original in situ experiment opens interesting possibilities for the investigation of plastic deformation at the nanoscale.},

Such a discontinuity gives rise, in general, to rods of scattering in reciprocal space which are most intense close to the Bragg peaks tau and are well defined for sufficiently smooth surfaces. For wave-vector transfer Q= tau +q the q-dependence of the intensity of scattering gives information on the topographic structure of the crystal surface. Experimental results on crystals of GaAs and KTaO3, with surfaces prepared in various ways, were obtained using conventional X-ray techniques with a rotating anode source and can be described by a continuum model of the surface. There are discrepancies between the predictions of the models and the experimental results and these suggest that further experiments are needed to achieve a more complete understanding.}

To explain the precise form of the momentum-transfer depen- dence of the intensity across the reciprocal-space zone, it is necessary to include the effects of surface roughness on an atomic scale.

To address this problem, we utilize a phase-retrieval method with a Fourier constraint specifically tailored for undersampled diffraction data measured with coarse-pitched detector pixels that bin the underlying signal. With our approach, we show that it is possible to reconstruct three-dimensional strained crystallites from an undersampled Bragg diffraction data set subject to pixel-area integration without having to physically upsample the diffraction signal. Using simulations and experimental results, we demonstrate that explicit modeling of Fourier-space compression during phase retrieval provides a viable means by which to invert high-energy BCDI data, which is otherwise intractable.},

abstract = {The past few years have seen a tremendous growth in the field of coherent X-ray diffractive imaging, in large part due to X-ray free-electron lasers which provide a peak brilliance billions of times higher than that of synchrotrons. However, this rapid development in terms of hardware has not been matched on the software side. The release of Hawk is intended to close this gap. To the authors knowledge Hawk is the first publicly available and fully open source software program for reconstructing images from continuous diffraction patterns. The software handles all steps leading from a raw diffraction pattern to a reconstructed two-dimensional image including geometry determination, background correction, masking and phasing. It also includes preliminary three-dimensional support and support for graphics processing units using the Compute Unified Device Architecture, which speeds up processing by orders of magnitude compared to a single central processing unit. Hawk implements numerous algorithms and is easily extended. This, in combination with its open-source licence, provides a platform for other groups to test, develop and distribute their own algorithms.

abstract = {Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) is a powerful technique to explore the local strain state and morphology of microscale crystals. The method can potentially reach nanometer-scale spatial resolution thanks to the advances in synchrotron design that dramatically increase coherent flux. However, there are experimental bottlenecks that may limit the image reconstruction quality from future high signal-to-noise ratio measurements. In this work we show that angular uncertainty of the sample orientation with respect to a fixed incoming beam is one example of such a factor, and we present a method to mitigate the resulting artifacts. On the basis of an alternative formulation of the forward problem, we design a phase retrieval algorithm which enables the simultaneous reconstruction of the object and determination of the exact angular position corresponding to each diffraction pattern in the data set. We have tested the algorithm performance on simulated data for different degrees of angular uncertainty and signal-to-noise ratio.},

Phase retrieval and its applications have been attractive research topics in optics and photonics, for example, in biomedical imaging, astronomical imaging, and so on. Most conventional phase retrieval methods have used iterative processes to recover phase information; however, the calculation speed and convergence with these methods are serious issues in real-time monitoring applications. Machine-learning-based methods are promising for addressing these issues. Here, we numerically compare conventional methods and a machine-learning-based method in which a convolutional neural network is employed. Simulations with several conditions show that the machine-learning-based method realizes fast and robust phase recovery compared with the conventional methods. We also numerically demonstrate machine-learning-based phase retrieval from noisy measurements with a noisy training data set for improving the noise robustness. The machine-learning-based approach used in this study may increase the impact of phase retrieval, which is useful in various fields, where phase retrieval has been used as a fundamental tool.},

abstract={Selective oxidation of ammonia to nitric oxide over platinum-group metal alloy gauzes is the crucial step for nitric acid production, a century-old yet greenhouse gas and capital intensive process. Therefore, developing alternative ammonia oxidation technologies with low environmental impacts and reduced catalyst cost are of significant importance. Herein, we propose and demonstrate a chemical looping ammonia oxidation catalyst and process to replace the costly noble metal catalysts and to reduce greenhouse gas emission. The proposed process exhibit near complete NH3 conversion and exceptional NO selectivity with negligible N2O production, using nonprecious V2O5 redox catalyst at 650 oC. Operando spectroscopy techniques and density functional theory calculations point towards a modified, temporally separated Mars-van Krevelen mechanism featuring a reversible V5+/V4+ redox cycle. The V{\thinspace}={\thinspace}O sites are suggested to be the catalytically active center leading to the formation of the oxidation products. Meanwhile, both V{\thinspace}={\thinspace}O and doubly coordinated oxygen participate in the hydrogen transfer process. The outstanding performance originates from the low activation energies for the successive hydrogen abstraction, facile NO formation as well as the easy regeneration of V{\thinspace}={\thinspace}O species. Our results highlight a transformational process in extending the chemical looping strategy to producing base chemicals in a sustainable and cost-effective manner.},

These defects and their surrounding elastic strain fields have a critical influence on the macroscopic properties and functionality of materials. However, their identification in Bragg coherent diffraction imaging remains a challenge and requires significant data mining. The ability to identify defects from the diffraction pattern alone would be a significant advantage when targeting specific defect types and accelerates experiment design and execution. Here, we exploit a computational tool based on a three-dimensional (3D) parametric atomistic model and a convolutional neural network to predict dislocations in a crystal from its 3D coherent diffraction pattern. Simulated diffraction patterns from several thousands of relaxed atomistic configurations of nanocrystals are used to train the neural network and to predict the presence or absence of dislocations as well as their type (screw or edge). Our study paves the way for defect-recognition in 3D coherent diffraction patterns for material science.},

@article{Yao2021,
abstract = {Ptychography is a rapidly developing scanning microscopy which is able to view the internal structures of samples at a high resolution beyond the illumination size. The achieved spatial resolution is theoretically dose-limited. A broadband source can provide much higher flux compared with a monochromatic source; however, it conflicts with the necessary coherence requirements of this coherent diffraction imaging technique. In this paper, a multi-wavelength reconstruction algorithm has been developed to deal with the broad bandwidth in ptychography. Compared with the latest development of mixed-state reconstruction approach, this multi-wavelength approach is more accurate in the physical model, and also considers the spot size variation as a function of energy due to the chromatic focusing optics. Therefore, this method has been proved in both simulation and experiment to significantly improve the reconstruction when the source bandwidth, illumination size and scan step size increase. It is worth mentioning that the accurate and detailed information of the energy spectrum for the incident beam is not required in advance for the proposed method. Further, we combine multi-wavelength and mixed-state approaches to jointly solve temporal and spatial partial coherence in ptychography so that it can handle various disadvantageous experimental effects. The significant relaxation in coherence requirements by our approaches allows the use of high-flux broadband X-ray sources for high-efficient and high-resolution ptychographic imaging.},

abstract = {We describe the next-generation system for in situ characterization of a complex oxide thin film and heterostructure growth by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) using synchrotron hard X-rays. The system consists of a PLD chamber mounted on a diffractometer allowing both real-time surface X-ray diffraction (SXRD) and in situ hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES). HAXPES is performed in the incident X-ray energy range from 4 to 12 keV using a Scienta EW4000 electron energy analyzer mounted on the PLD chamber fixed parallel with the surface normal. In addition to the standard application mode of HAXPES for disentangling surface from bulk properties, the increased penetration depth of high energy photoelectrons is used for investigation of the electronic structure changes through thin films grown deliberately as variable thickness capping layers. Such heterostructures represent model systems for investigating a variety of critical thickness and dead layer phenomena observed at complex oxide interfaces. In this new mode of operation, in situ HAXPES is used to determine the electronic structure associated with unique structural features identified by real-time SXRD during thin film growth. The system is configured for using both laboratory excitation sources off-line and on-line operation at beamline 33-ID-D at the Advanced Photon Source. We illustrate the performance of the system by preliminary scattering and spectroscopic data on oxygen vacancy ordering induced perovskite-to-brownmillerite reversible phase transformation in La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 films capped with oxygen deficient SrTiO3-$\delta$ (100) layers of varying thickness.},

   abstract = {Catalysts are materials that accelerate the rate of a desired chemical reaction. As such, they constitute an integral part in many applications ranging from the production of fine chemicals in chemical industry to exhaust gas treatment in vehicles. Accordingly, it is of utmost economic interest to improve catalyst efficiency and performance, which requires an understanding of the interplay between the catalyst structure, the gas phase and the catalytic activity under realistic reaction conditions at ambient pressures and elevated temperatures. In recent years efforts have been made to increasingly develop techniques that allow for investigating model catalyst samples under conditions closer to those of real technical catalysts. One of these techniques is high energy surface x-ray diffraction (HESXRD), which uses x-rays with photon energies typically in the range of 70-80 keV. HESXRD allows a fast data collection of three dimensional reciprocal space for the structure determination of model catalyst samples under operando conditions and has since been used for the investigation of an increasing number of different model catalysts. In this article we will review general considerations of HESXRD including its working principle for different model catalyst samples and the experimental equipment required. An overview over HESXRD investigations performed in recent years will be given, and the advantages of HESXRD with respect to its application to different model catalyst samples will be presented. Moreover, the combination of HESXRD with other operando techniques such as in situ mass spectrometry, planar laser-induced fluorescence and surface optical reflectance will be discussed. The article will close with an outlook on future perspectives and applications of HESXRD.},

abstract = {The evolution of morphology and internal strain under high pressure fundamentally alters the physical property, structural stability, phase transition and deformation mechanism of materials. Until now, only averaged strain distributions have been studied. Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging is highly sensitive to the internal strain distribution of individual crystals but requires coherent illumination, which can be compromised by the complex high-pressure sample environment. Here we report the successful de-convolution of these effects with the recently developed mutual coherent function method to reveal the three-dimensional strain distribution inside a 400 nm gold single crystal during compression within a diamond-anvil cell. The three-dimensional morphology and evolution of the strain under pressures up to 6.4 GPa were obtained with better than 30 nm spatial resolution. In addition to providing a new approach for high-pressure nanotechnology and rheology studies, we draw fundamental conclusions about the origin of the anomalous compressibility of nanocrystals. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Defects in GaN, like inversion domain boundaries (IDBs), significantly affect the electrical and optical properties of the material. We report, here, on the structural configurations of planar inversion domain boundaries inside n-doped GaN wires measured by Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging. Different complex domain configurations are revealed along the wires with a 9 nm in-plane spatial resolution. We demonstrate that the IDBs change their direction of propagation along the wires, promoting Ga-terminated domains and stabilizing into {11¯ 00}, that is, m-planes. The atomic phase shift between the Ga- and N-terminated domains was extracted using phase-retrieval algorithms, revealing an evolution of the out-of-plane displacement (∼5 pm, at maximum) between inversion domains along the wires.

abstract = {Imaging with low-dose light is of importance in various fields, especially when minimizing radiation-induced damage onto samples is desirable. The raw image captured at the detector plane is then predominantly a Poisson random process with Gaussian noise added due to the quantum nature of photo-electric conversion. Under such noisy conditions, highly ill-posed problems such as phase retrieval from raw intensity measurements become prone to strong artifacts in the reconstructions; a situation that deep neural networks (DNNs) have already been shown to be useful at improving. Here, we demonstrate that random phase modulation on the optical field, also known as coherent modulation imaging (CMI), in conjunction with the phase extraction neural network (PhENN) and a Gerchberg-Saxton-Fienup (GSF) approximant, further improves resilience to noise of the phase-from-intensity imaging problem. We offer design guidelines for implementing the CMI hardware with the proposed computational reconstruction scheme and quantify reconstruction improvement as function of photon count.},

Existing techniques for the visualization of strain fields, such as transmission electron microscopy and diffraction, are destructive and limited to thin slices of the materials. On the other hand, non-destructive X-ray imaging methods either have a reduced resolution or are not robust enough for a broad range of applications. Here we present X-ray ptychographic topography, a new method for strain imaging, and demonstrate its use on an InSb micro-pillar after micro-compression, where the strained region is visualized with a spatial resolution of 30 nm.

Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (BCDI) has emerged as a powerful tool capable of identifying dislocations, twin domains, and other defects in 3D detail with nanometer spatial resolution within nanocrystals and grains in reactive environments. However, BCDI relies on phase retrieval algorithms that can fail to accurately reconstruct the defect network. Here, we use numerical simulations to explore different guided phase retrieval algorithms for imaging defective crystals using BCDI. We explore different defect types, defect densities, Bragg peaks, and guided algorithm fitness metrics as a function of signal-to-noise ratio. Based on these results, we offer a general prescription for phasing of defective crystals with no a priori knowledge.},

The experiment was performed at a temperature of 400 K under continuous gas flow conditions of pure Ar and Ar/CO mixtures. The nanoparticle was preselected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and postanalyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). We obtain a very good agreement between the overall nanoparticle size, shape, and defect structure as determined by CXDI and AFM. In addition, we compare the strain state in the nanoparticle near surface region and its bulk: For pure Ar flow, we find a slight compressive strain in the nanoparticle bulk compared to an expansion in the near surface region. We ascribe the latter to the presence of high index vicinal surfaces. Our analysis suggests that under mixed Ar/CO flow at 400 K reshaping of the nanoparticle occurred. New high index facets developed, leading to a stronger lattice expansion, also propagating into the nanoparticle bulk. Our high-resolution experiments pave the way for future CXDI experiments under operando catalytic reaction conditions.},

Defects may have a strong effect on the physical properties of materials. As the majority of defects produce lattice distortions, hence these can be imaged. Here we describe the instrumentation at ID01 required to produce such foci and the protocols employed to ensure reliable data acquisition. The wavefront of the incident beam must be coherent in order to observe interference. Thus the coherent probe is recovered online via ptychography on a reference structure at the beginning of every experiment, and can be executed at any time to confirm beam quality and maintain experimental consistency. Due to the small source size in the vertical direction a diffraction limited spot is achieved, whereas in the horizontal the beam size is defined by the image of the source.

Researchers have begun to tell a more complete story of catalysis from a perspective which brings this concept to the forefront of the discussion. The nano-'realm' makes the effects of surface lattice strain, which acts on the same spatial scales, more pronounced due to a higher ratio of surface to bulk atoms. This is especially evident in the field of metal nanoparticle catalysis, where displacement of atoms on surfaces can significantly alter the sorption properties of molecules. In part, the concept of strain-engineering for catalysis opened up due to the achievements that were made in the synthesis of a more sophisticated nanoparticle library from an ever-expanding set of methodologies. Developing synthesis methods for metal nanoparticles with well-defined and strained architectures is a worthy goal that, if reached, will have considerable impact in the search for catalysts. In this review, we summarize the recent accomplishments in the area of surface lattice-strained metal nanoparticle synthesis, framing the discussion from the important perspective of surface lattice strain effects in catalysis.},

abstract = {Ptychographic imaging is a powerful means of imaging beyond the resolution limits of typical x-ray optics. Recovering images from raw ptychographic data, however, requires the solution of an inverse problem, namely, phase retrieval. Phase retrieval algorithms are computationally expensive, which precludes real-time imaging. In this work, we propose PtychoNN, an approach to solve the ptychography data inversion problem based on a deep convolutional neural network. We demonstrate how the proposed method can be used to predict real-space structure and phase at each scan point solely from the corresponding far-field diffraction data. Our results demonstrate the practical application of machine learning to recover high fidelity amplitude and phase contrast images of a real sample hundreds of times faster than current ptychography reconstruction packages. Furthermore, by overcoming the constraints of iterative model-based methods, we can significantly relax sampling constraints on data acquisition while still producing an excellent image of the sample. Besides drastically accelerating acquisition and analysis, this capability has profound implications for the imaging of dose sensitive, dynamic, and extremely voluminous samples.},

abstract = {Coherent Diffractive Imaging (CDI) allows images to be reconstructed from diffraction patterns by solving the non-crystallographic phase problem for isolated nanostructures. We show that the Shannon sampling of diffraction intensities needed in CDI requires a coherence width about twice the lateral dimensions of the object, and that the linear number of detector pixels fixes the energy spread needed in the beam. The Shannon sampling, defined by the transform of the periodically repeated autocorrelation of the object, is related to Bragg scattering from an equivalent crystal, and shown to be consistent with the sampling of Young's fringes established by scattering from extreme points in the object. The results are relevant to the design of diffraction cameras for CDI and plans for femotosecond X-ray diffraction from individual proteins. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A Scientific Integrity Consortium developed a set of recommended principles and best practices that can be used broadly across scientific disciplines as a mechanism for consensus on scientific integrity standards and to better equip scientists to operate in a rapidly changing research environment. The two principles that represent the umbrella under which scientific processes should operate are as follows: (1) Foster a culture of integrity in the scientific process. (2) Evidence-based policy interests may have legitimate roles to play in influencing aspects of the research process, but those roles should not interfere with scientific integrity. The nine best practices for instilling scientific integrity in the implementation of these two overarching principles are (1) Require universal training in robust scientific methods, in the use of appropriate experimental design and statistics, and in responsible research practices for scientists at all levels, with the training content regularly updated and presented by qualified scientists. (2) Strengthen scientific integrity oversight and processes throughout the research continuum with a focus on training in ethics and conduct. (3) Encourage reproducibility of research through transparency. (4) Strive to establish open science as the standard operating procedure throughout the scientific enterprise. (5) Develop and implement educational tools to teach communication skills that uphold scientific integrity. (6) Strive to identify ways to further strengthen the peer review process. (7) Encourage scientific journals to publish unanticipated findings that meet standards of quality and scientific integrity. (8) Seek harmonization and implementation among journals of rapid, consistent, and transparent processes for correction and/or retraction of published papers. (9) Design rigorous and comprehensive evaluation criteria that recognize and reward the highest standards of integrity in scientific research.},

To improve catalyst efficiency, it is important to understand oxidation processes on the atomic scale. Here, we studied oxygen-induced shape changes of Pt nanoparticles on MgO(001) by means of in situ surface X-ray diffraction and X-ray reflectivity measurements. The X-ray results on the particle morphology were complemented by transmission electron microscopy studies. The samples were prepared by means of physical vapor deposition and differed in average particle size and lateral particle size distribution. The oxygen-induced particle shape changes were found to be independent of particle size and were characterized by the emergence of higher indexed facets. We find the bulk oxide formation to be kinetically hindered and particle size-dependent. The formed bulk oxide structures were concluded to be (110)-oriented Pt3O4 and a modified structure of (0001)-oriented $\alpha$-PtO2.CO exposure of the oxidized particles did not lead to a shape change reversibility.},

abstract = {X-ray ptychography is a rapidly developing coherent diffraction imaging technique that provides nanoscale resolution on extended field-of-view. However, the requirement of coherence and the scanning mechanism limit the throughput of ptychographic imaging. In this paper, we propose X-ray ptychography using multiple illuminations instead of single illumination in conventional ptychography. Multiple locations of the sample are simultaneously imaged by spatially separated X-ray beams, therefore, the obtained field-of-view in one scan can be enlarged by a factor equal to the number of illuminations. We have demonstrated this technique experimentally using two X-ray beams focused by a house-made Fresnel zone plate array. Two areas of the object and corresponding double illuminations were successfully reconstructed from diffraction patterns acquired in one scan, with image quality similar with those obtained by conventional single-beam ptychography in sequence. Multi-beam ptychography approach increases the imaging speed, providing an efficient way for high-resolution imaging of large extended specimens.},

Vacuum annealing at temperatures above 800 K led to significant Pt sintering that reduced CO uptake to a much higher extent than the Pt surface area. A similar effect on CO adsorption was observed after mild oxidation-reduction treatment at 500 K. The results are rationalized in terms of the strong metal-support interaction between Pt and Fe3O4, whereby the Pt particles were encapsulated by a FeO (111) monolayer film as shown by STM. The high adhesion energy between Pt and iron oxides derived from STM data is suggested to be the key factor for encapsulation. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Au/CeO2 (0.25% wt. Au) catalysts were prepared by anchoring preformed Au nanoparticles over ceria polycrystals, cubes and rods and tested in the oxidation of CO and COPrOx. The use of preformed Au nanoparticles assured a constant Au particle size (ca. 5 nm by HRTEM) for all samples, which allowed to a precise assessment of the effect of the morphology of nanoshaped ceria on catalytic activity. The catalytic performance of the Au/CeO2-rods was much better than that of the Au/CeO2-polycrystals and Au/CeO2-cubes both in the oxidation of CO and COPrOx reactions. The Au/CeO2-rods exhibited the highest amount of oxidized Au and Ce(III) species by XPS, whereas in the Au/CeO2-cubes gold was totally metallic and the amount of Ce(III) was minimum. An intermediate situation was encountered in the Au/CeO2-polycrystals. Considering the differences in the oxidation states of Au and Ce and the fact that all samples were prepared with preformed metallic Au nanoparticles of the same size, the results indicate that the intrinsic nature of the different ceria surfaces exerts a prominent role in the gold-ceria interaction and in the electron density transfer from Au to Ce, which in turn has a strong effect on catalytic activity. Gold nanoparticles strongly interact with CeO2-{1 1 0} surfaces with respect to CeO2-{1 1 1} and CeO2-{1 0 0}, even when Au nanoparticles are prepared separately and simply deposited by impregnation.},

abstract = {Phase retrieval, the problem of recovering lost phase information from measured intensity alone, is an inverse problem that is widely faced in various imaging modalities ranging from astronomy to nanoscale imaging. The current process of phase recovery is iterative in nature. As a result, the image formation is time-consuming and computationally expensive, precluding real-time imaging. Here, we use 3D nanoscale X-ray imaging as a representative example to develop a deep learning model to address this phase retrieval problem. We introduce 3D-CDI-NN, a deep convolutional neural network and differential programming framework trained to predict 3D structure and strain solely from input 3D X-ray coherent scattering data. Our networks are designed to be ‘physics-aware' in multiple aspects; in that the physics of x-ray scattering process is explicitly enforced in the training of the network, and the training data are drawn from atomistic simulations that are representative of the physics of the material. We further refine the neural network prediction through a physics-based optimization procedure to enable maximum accuracy at lowest computational cost. 3D-CDI-NN can invert a 3D coherent diffraction pattern to real-space structure and strain hundreds of times faster than traditional iterative phase retrieval methods, with negligible loss in accuracy. Our integrated machine learning and differential programming solution to the phase retrieval problem is broadly applicable across inverse problems in other application areas.},

The capability of present-day synchrotrons to locate and measure a multiplicity of Bragg reflections from a single grain makes it possible to recover the full strain tensor with nanometer resolution. Recent methods for coupling reconstructions from several peaks to determine the strain tensor have been developed and applied to synthetic data, but have not been applied to experimental data. Here, using a coupled genetic reconstruction algorithm, we reconstruct an experimental data set and demonstrate improvements in the ability to resolve vector-valued displacement fields internal to the particle as compared to what is achieved with a noncoupled approach. The coupled approach developed in this work was also validated on simulated data sets. In both simulated and experimental data, reconstructions from our coupled Bragg peak algorithm show improvements over the noncoupled independent reconstruction method of 5% in terms of accuracy and 53% in terms of consistency.},

However, even when the signal from a single Bragg reflection with (hkl) Miller indices is found, the crystallographic axes on the retrieved three-dimensional (3D) image of the crystal remain unknown, and thus localizing in reciprocal space other Bragg reflections becomes time-consuming or requires good knowledge of the orientation of the crystal. Here, the commissioning of a movable double-bounce Si (111) monochromator at the 34-ID-C endstation of the Advanced Photon Source is reported, which aims at delivering multi-reflection BCDI as a standard tool in a single beamline instrument. The new instrument enables, through rapid switching from monochromatic to broadband (pink) beam, the use of Laue diffraction to determine crystal orientation. With a proper orientation matrix determined for the lattice, one can measure coherent diffraction patterns near multiple Bragg peaks, thus providing sufficient information to image the full strain tensor in 3D. The design, concept of operation, the developed procedures for indexing Laue patterns, and automated measuring of Bragg coherent diffraction data from multiple reflections of the same nanocrystal are discussed.},

abstract = {The molecular mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation on a Ni(111) surface has been thoroughly investigated by means of periodic density functional theory calculations, including dispersion interactions, along with accurate kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, including lateral interactions between the adsorbates. The present reaction model involves 25 different species and a total of 86 elementary processes, including adsorptions, desorptions, surface chemical steps, and diffusions. The reaction network accounts for three different mechanisms for the reverse water-gas shift reaction and three different mechanisms for methanation. The kinetic Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the reverse water-gas shift reaction dominates the CO2 hydrogenation on Ni(111) with no evidence of methane formation. The reaction proceeds mainly through the redox route, with the carboxyl pathway also being active but to a lesser extent. Methane production is hindered by the H + CO → HCO endothermicity and the prohibitive energy barrier for CO dissociation, implying CO desorption rather than evolution through the Sabatier reaction. A detailed comparison to earlier theoretical studies supporting the methanation reaction shows that some unreliable assumptions along with limited theoretical approaches biased the former conclusion.},

We present operando surface X-ray diffraction studies of two structurally well-defined epitaxial cobalt oxide thin films: Co3O4(111) and CoOOH(001) electrodeposited on Au(111). The potential-dependent structural changes during cyclic voltammograms were monitored with high time resolution up to OER current densities as high as 150 mA cm-2. The CoOOH(001) film is found to be smooth and perfectly stable over a wide potential range. In the case of Co3O4(111), fast and fully reversible structural changes are observed. Specifically, the surface region of Co3O4(111) starts restructuring at potentials 300 mV negative of the onset of the OER, indicating that the process is related to the thermodynamically predicted Co3O4/CoOOH(001) transition rather than to the catalytic reaction. The formed skin layer is of defined thickness, which changes linearly with applied potential, and is the OER active phase. Surprisingly, the catalytic activity of the skin layer covered Co3O4 film and that of the smooth CoOOH(001) are almost identical, if the true microscopic surface area is taken into account. This indicates that the number of OER active sites on the two oxides is similar, despite the very different defect density, and is at variance with previous suggestions that di-$\mu$-oxo bridged Co cations are exclusively responsible for the OER activity of Co oxides. For the smooth CoOOH(001), a turnover frequency of 4.2 s-1 per surface atom is determined at an overpotential of 400 mV. Furthermore, our studies demonstrate that the pseudocapacitive charging current in the pre-OER potential range must be assigned to a bulk process that is accompanied by potential-dependent changes of the unit cell volume in the Co3O4 bulk.},

The numerical investigation suggests that the superb performance of Bragg CDI is achieved with an oversampling ratio above 30 and a detection dynamic range above 6 orders. The observed performance degradation subject to the data binning processes is also studied.

abstract = {By using phase retrieval, Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (BCDI) allows tracking of three-dimensional displacement fields inside individual nanocrystals. Nevertheless, during structural phase transformations, significant strains (1% and higher) are common, and BCDI fails due to the Bragg peak distortions. Here we present and advanced BCDI algorithm enabling imaging three-dimensional strain fields in highly strained crystals with separated structural phases. We test the algorithm on particles simulated to undergo a structural phase transformation. While the conventional algorithms fail in unambiguously reconstructing the phase morphology, our algorithm correctly retrieves the morphology of coexistent phases with a strain difference of 1%. The key novelty is the simultaneous reconstruction of multiple scans of the same nanoparticle at snapshots through the phase transformations. The algorithm enables visualizing phase transformations in nanoparticles of lithium-ion, sodium-ion nanoparticles, and other nanoparticulate materials in working conditions (operando).},

abstract = {Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI), a technique where an object is reconstructed from a single (2D or 3D) diffraction pattern, recovers the lost diffraction phases without a priori knowledge of the extent (support) of the object. The uncertainty of the object support can lead to over-fitting and prevents an unambiguous metric evaluation of solutions. We propose to use a ‘free' log-likelihood indicator, where a small percentage of points are masked from the reconstruction algorithms, as an unbiased metric to evaluate the validity of computed solutions, independent of the sample studied. We also show how a set of solutions can be analysed through an eigen-decomposition to yield a better estimate of the real object. Example analysis on experimental data is presented both for a test pattern dataset, and the diffraction pattern from a live cyanobacteria cell. The method allows the validation of reconstructions on a wide range of materials (hard condensed or biological), and should be particularly relevant for 4th generation synchrotrons and X-ray free electron lasers, where large, high-throughput datasets require a method for unsupervised data evaluation.},

abstract = {Electrocatalysis is at the heart of a broad range of physicochemical applications that play an important role in the present and future of a sustainable economy. Among the myriad of different electrocatalysts used in this field, nanomaterials are of ubiquitous importance. An increased surface area/volume ratio compared to bulk makes nanoscale catalysts the preferred choice to perform electrocatalytic reactions. Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) was introduced in 2006 and since has been applied to obtain 3D images of crystalline nanomaterials. BCDI provides information about the displacement field, which is directly related to strain. Lattice strain in the catalysts impacts their electronic configuration and, consequently, their binding energy with reaction intermediates. Even though there have been significant improvements since its birth, the fact that the experiments can only be performed at synchrotron facilities and its relatively low resolution to date (∼10 nm spatial resolution) have prevented the popularization of this technique. Herein, we will briefly describe the fundamentals of the technique, including the electrocatalysis relevant information that we can extract from it. Subsequently, we review some of the computational experiments that complement the BCDI data for enhanced information extraction and improved understanding of the underlying nanoscale electrocatalytic processes. We next highlight success stories of BCDI applied to different electrochemical systems and in heterogeneous catalysis to show how the technique can contribute to future studies in electrocatalysis. Finally, we outline current challenges in spatiotemporal resolution limits of BCDI and provide our perspectives on recent developments in synchrotron facilities as well as the role of machine learning and artificial intelligence in addressing them.},

abstract = {Abstract The literature provides insights for catalyst design and discovery. Effective analysis of reported data using machine learning (ML) methods offers the ability to gain valuable information. However, utilizing the literature in this way has obstacles such as lack of compositional overlaps, bias from prior published data, and low sample counts for many elements. The present study describes an ML approach that considers elemental features as input representations instead of inputting catalyst compositions directly. This ML method has the potential for catalyst discovery, including catalytic reactions with limited catalyst composition overlap in the available data. Oxidative coupling of methane (OCM), water gas shift (WGS), and CO oxidation reactions were chosen to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method by analysis using several state-of-the-art ML methods. Among the ML methods tested, gradient boosting regression with XGBoost (XGB) provided the best results, and prediction accuracy was improved by the proposed approach for all three reaction types. In addition, a quantitative value of “feature importance score” was calculated to evaluate the most influential input variables on catalyst performance. Finally, catalyst optimization was explored using ML as a “surrogate” model, and the top 20 promising candidate catalysts were identified for the OCM reaction based on the optimization. The advantages of ML in catalysis analysis as well as the difficulties and limitations originating from the complexity of heterogeneous catalysis were explored.},

abstract={Catalysis is at the core of chemistry and has been essential to make all the goods surrounding us, including fuels, coatings, plastics and other functional materials. In the near future, catalysis will also be an essential tool in making the shift from a fossil-fuel-based to a more renewable and circular society. To make this reality, we have to better understand the fundamental concept of the active site in catalysis. Here, we discuss the physical meaning --- and deduce the validity and, therefore, usefulness --- of some common approaches in heterogeneous catalysis, such as linking catalyst activity to a `turnover frequency' and explaining catalytic performance in terms of `structure sensitivity' or `structure insensitivity'. Catalytic concepts from the fields of enzymatic and homogeneous catalysis are compared, ultimately realizing that the struggle that one encounters in defining the active site in most solid catalysts is likely the one we must overcome to reach our end goal: tailoring the precise functioning of the active sites with respect to many different parameters to satisfy our ever-growing needs. This article ends with an outlook of what may become feasible within the not-too-distant future with modern experimental and theoretical tools at hand.},

   abstract = {The preferential oxidation of CO in H2-rich mixtures (COPrOx) is a major catalytic reaction utilized for hydrogen purification. In the exploration of alternatives to noble metals, cobalt-based catalysts appear to be a very promising choice. The activity and stability of cobalt in the COPrOx reaction can be improved by the addition of transition metals and manganese is maybe the most prominent among them. Yet, the arrangement of the two components in the catalytically active state is largely unknown, which hinders in-depth understanding of the manganese promotion effect. Here, we compare pure and Mn-modified cobalt catalysts and correlate their structural and chemical characteristics with their COPrOx performance. The Mn-promoted cobalt catalyst is significantly more active than pure cobalt especially at intermediate reaction temperatures (around 200 °C). The addition of Mn improves the structural stability of the catalyst and helps to maintain higher specific surface areas. Chemical and microstructural analysis using various operando and in situ techniques revealed that Mn promotes CO conversion by partially stabilizing CoO phase during reaction conditions. It is also suggested that at high temperature, Mn suppress CO methanation reaction but promotes H2 oxidation. Apart of the particular interest in COPrOx reaction, in a general context, this work shows how the spatial distribution of the different catalyst components at nanoscopic level, may affect the surface chemistry and consequently control the reactivity.},

abstract = {This review highlights key catalytic discoveries and the main industrial catalytic processes over the last 300 years that involved commodities, fine chemicals, petrochemicals, petroleum transformation for fuels and energy supply, emission control, and so forth. In the past, discoveries have often followed events such as wars or embargos, whereas the current driving forces of studies, researches and then discoveries aim at a better understanding of catalytic processes, at reducing the costs of raw materials and processes, at developing new catalytic materials and at addressing environmental issues. This review focuses on the history of many catalytic industrial processes, environmental issues, catalytic materials, especially their expected catalytic properties, on catalyst characterisation by physical methods and development of in situ conditions, i.e., characterisation under actual working conditions with reactants and products analyzed on-line. Emphasis is also placed on high selectivity in catalytic reactions and the major challenges for the future, such as environmental issues, energy supply, pollution control for vehicles and industrial plants, air/VOCs/water purification, hydrogen sources and carbon dioxide storage/up grading, transformation of biomass as a promising source of raw materials, and catalytic water splitting perspectives. This review is a survey of heterogeneous catalysis and is not comprehensive but leads to the conclusion that, although many catalysts and catalytic processes have already been discovered and developed over the past century, many opportunities nevertheless exist for new developments, new processes and new catalytic materials. It follows that substantial challenges exist for the younger generation of researchers and engineers, as emphasized at the end of the manuscript.}

They are calculated within the tight-binding approximation using a moment method and a continued fraction analysis. The d band degeneracy and the charge rearrangement occurring near the surface when cleaving the crystal are fully taken into account by computing exactly a large number of moments (22–26). The surface LDS are found to be strongly dependent on the cleavage plane. Indeed, whereas the LDS on dense planes are rather bulk like, sharp peaks arising from states localized near the surface are obtained near the atomic level of the metal on non-dense planes of cleavage. In addition, the bandwidth is broadened by surface states for Ni. On the contrary, for bcc Fe the surface potential is not strong enough to modify the bandwidth. A comparison is made with spectroscopic observations. The method lends itself to other interesting applications in the surface physics field and, as an example, we present the results of calculations of the spatial distribution of the electronic charge near the surface and its deviation from spherical symmetry. The charge asphericity is slightly increased when going from a bulk to a surface site as the difference between the occupations of two surface orbitals can reach 0.34 ē instead of 0.15 -c for a bulk site. Diagrams are shown for (100) and (110) cleaved Ni to illustrate the results. The consequences upon preferred adsorption sites according to the electronic affinity and size of the adsorbate are discussed.}

Also in 2016, it was 75 years ago that Eley and Rideal studied the mechanism of the reaction between a chemisorbed molecule and a physisorbed molecule. However, they studied a very special case of adsorption, whereas the more general interaction of a chemisorbed molecule and a molecule colliding with it from the gas phase had already been proposed by Langmuir in addition to the reaction between two chemisorbed molecules. Therefore, the reaction between a chemisorbed molecule and a gaseous colliding molecule should be called Langmuir--Rideal reaction rather than Eley--Rideal reaction, as it is often called in surface science, catalysis and astronomy. The mechanism that Eley and Rideal really studied some 75 years ago is important in heterogeneous as well as homogeneous catalysis in the liquid-phase and is related to outer-sphere reactions.},

Usually NP catalysts are prepared from a metal salt, a reducing agent, and a stabilizer and are supported on an oxide, charcoal, or a zeolite. Besides the polymers and oxides that used to be employed as standard, innovative stabilizers, media, and supports have appeared, such as dendrimers, specific ligands, ionic liquids, surfactants, membranes, carbon nanotubes, and a variety of oxides. Ligand-free procedures have provided remarkable results with extremely low metal loading.

It allows for the preparation and study of catalytically active single crystal surfaces and is also equipped with an evaporator for the deposition of thin, pure metal films, necessary for the formation of small metal particles on oxide supports. Reactions can be studied in flow mode and batch mode in a pressure range of 100-1200 mbar and temperatures up to 950 K.

@article{Vendelbo2014,
abstract = {Many catalytic reactions under fixed conditions exhibit oscillatory behaviour. The oscillations are often attributed to dynamic changes in the catalyst surface. So far, however, such relationships were difficult to determine for catalysts consisting of supported nanoparticles. Here, we employ a nanoreactor to study the oscillatory CO oxidation catalysed by Pt nanoparticles using time-resolved high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, mass spectrometry and calorimetry. The observations reveal that periodic changes in the CO oxidation are synchronous with a periodic refacetting of the Pt nanoparticles. The oscillatory reaction is modelled using density functional theory and mass transport calculations, considering the CO adsorption energy and the oxidation rate as site-dependent. We find that to successfully explain the oscillations, the model must contain the phenomenon of refacetting. The nanoreactor approach can thus provide atomic-scale information that is specific to surface sites. This will improve the understanding of dynamic properties in catalysis and related fields. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

After his “docteur ès sciences” thesis on sulphides in 1880 under the guidance of Marcellin Berthelot at Collège de France in Paris, and a very short stay at the University of Bordeaux to teach physics, he became Professor of Chemistry at the University of Toulouse from 1884 until he retired in 1930. Sabatier worked on different subjects (noteworthy is his book on agricultural chemistry) before concentrating on the subject which earned him the celebrity. The publications of Mond et al. (action of carbon monoxide on nickel) and of Moissan and Moureu (action of acetylene on nickel) are at the origin of the work of Sabatier and Senderens who discovered the method of direct hydrogenation of organic molecules on finely disintegrated nickel. The paper raises the question as to why the Nobel Committee did not use the word catalysis in the nomination concerning Sabatier. As a matter of fact, Sabatier not only used catalysts but also proposed the first chemical theory of catalysis based “on the temporary formation of unstable chemical compounds which, serving as intermediate steps in the reaction, determine its direction or increase its velocity”. Among all the physical and chemical theories of catalysis proposed so far, that of Sabatier has undergone the test of time with success and still continues to be fertile. Paul Sabatier leaves a considerable legacy, not only locally (he is at the origin of three Schools of the Institut National Polytechnique of Toulouse) but also internationally (major contribution to the development of agricultural chemistry and industrial catalysis) and beyond, notably with the so-called “Sabatier” reaction (CO2+4H2→CH4+2H2O) currently used in the International Space Station to produce the water necessary onboard.}

Using a divide-and-conquer approach to generate inter-slice connectivity, we create a case table that defines triangle topology. The algorithm processes the 3D medical data in scan-line order and calculates triangle vertices using linear interpolation. We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data. Results from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) illustrate the quality and functionality of marching cubes. We also discuss improvements that decrease processing time and add solid modeling capabilities.},

abstract = {The X-ray Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) technique assumes that the structure factor holds constant over the measured crystal. This approximation breaks down for materials exhibiting variations in the unit-cell configuration, such as piezo- and ferroelectrics. In that case, the strain field cannot be reliably determined from the reconstruction because the lattice deformation and the structure factor contribute concomitantly. Proposed here is a solution to this problem achieved by combining Bragg CDI and the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction approach that measures a Friedel pair of reflections at two different photon energies near an absorption edge. Comparing the obtained reconstructions with a parametric model that includes calculating the scattering amplitude as a function of wavelength and the unit-cell configuration, the contributions of the lattice deformation and the structure factor are separated. Simulations of the ferroelectric material BaTiO3 demonstrate the possibility of simultaneous probing of the strain and displacement of the Ti atoms. The proposed method opens up an opportunity to apply coherent X-ray diffraction for nanoscale-resolved 3D mapping of polarization domains in micro- and nanocrystals.},

The ability to predict the structural evolution of catalytic nanocrystals during the reaction is of primary importance for catalyst design. However, to date, imaging and characterising the structure of defects inside a nanocrystal in three-dimensions and in situ during reaction has remained a challenge. We report here an unusual twin boundary migration process in a single platinum nanoparticle during CO oxidation using Bragg coherent diffraction imaging as the characterisation tool. Density functional theory calculations show that twin migration can be correlated with the relative change in the interfacial energies of the free surfaces exposed to CO. The x-ray technique also reveals particle reshaping during the reaction. In situ and non-invasive structural characterisation of defects during reaction opens new avenues for understanding defect behaviour in confined crystals and paves the way for strain and defect engineering.},

abstract = {Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging (BCDI) is a non-destructive, lensless method for 3D-resolved, nanoscale strain imaging in micro-crystals. A challenge, particularly for new users of the technique, is accurate mapping of experimental data, collected in the detector reciprocal space coordinate frame, to more convenient orthogonal coordinates, e.g. attached to the sample. This is particularly the case since different coordinate conventions are used at every BCDI beamline. The reconstruction algorithms and mapping scripts composed for individual beamlines are not readily interchangeable. To overcome this, a BCDI experiment simulation with a plugin script that converts all beamline angles to a universal, right-handed coordinate frame is introduced, making it possible to condense any beamline geometry into three rotation matrices. The simulation translates a user-specified 3D complex object to different BCDI-related coordinate frames. It also allows the generation of synthetic coherent diffraction data that can be inserted into any BCDI reconstruction algorithm to reconstruct the original user-specified object. Scripts are provided to map from sample space to detector conjugated space, detector conjugated space to sample space and detector conjugated space to detector conjugated space for a different reflection. This provides the reader with the basis for a flexible simulation tool kit that is easily adapted to different geometries. It is anticipated that this will find use in the generation of tailor-made supports for phasing of challenging data and exploration of novel geometries or data collection modalities.},

@article{Chan2020,
abstract = {Phase retrieval, the problem of recovering lost phase information from measured intensity alone, is an inverse problem that is widely faced in various imaging modalities ranging from astronomy to nanoscale imaging. The current process of phase recovery is iterative in nature. As a result, the image formation is time-consuming and computationally expensive, precluding real-time imaging. Here, we use 3D nanoscale X-ray imaging as a representative example to develop a deep learning model to address this phase retrieval problem. We introduce 3D-CDI-NN, a deep convolutional neural network and differential programming framework trained to predict 3D structure and strain solely from input 3D X-ray coherent scattering data. Our networks are designed to be ‘physics-aware' in multiple aspects; in that the physics of x-ray scattering process is explicitly enforced in the training of the network, and the training data are drawn from atomistic simulations that are representative of the physics of the material. We further refine the neural network prediction through a physics-based optimization procedure to enable maximum accuracy at lowest computational cost. 3D-CDI-NN can invert a 3D coherent diffraction pattern to real-space structure and strain hundreds of times faster than traditional iterative phase retrieval methods, with negligible loss in accuracy. Our integrated machine learning and differential programming solution to the phase retrieval problem is broadly applicable across inverse problems in other application areas.},

abstract = {High-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature-programmed XPS at BESSY II have been applied to investigate the adsorption and desorption of NO on a Pt(1 1 1) surface. The coverage and temperature-dependent bonding configurations of NO have been identified from adsorbate O 1s and substrate Pt 4f7/2 core-level photoemission spectra, which were collected in situ during NO uptake or heating with data collection times per spectrum between 4 and 7 s. At 110 K, NO molecularly adsorbs on Pt(1 1 1) and sequentially populates three different adsorption sites. Up to coverages of 0.25 ML, only fcc-hollow sites are occupied, leading to the formation of a (2 × 2)-NO adsorbate structure. As coverage increases, in addition on-top sites are populated until at 0.5 ML a (2 × 2)-2NO structure is formed, which also represents the saturation structure at 250 K. Further increasing the coverage at 110 K leads to the occupation of hcp-hollow sites; at saturation, a (2 × 2)-3NO structure is observed with a coverage of 0.75 ML. Upon heating, the desorption of NO from the hcp-hollow sites gives rise to a desorption peak at 190 K. Further heating induces the desorption of on-top NO species starting at 275 K and fcc-hollow NO species starting at 320 K. No dissociation takes place. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {In order to fully benefit from a beam produced by modern synchrotron light sources, characterised by a wide and continuous energy spectrum, high brightness and a very high intensity, advancement in detector technology has been made over the last decades. However, one of the main limitations of the state-of-the-art counting hybrid pixel detectors is the maximum count-rate that is very often few orders of magnitudes lower than of the incident, reflected or diffracted beam flux. Therefore, direct beam attenuation is mandatory in order to perform the measurements according to the detector's characteristics. In this work we present a major upgrade of a fast attenuation system developed at Synchrotron SOLEIL, which allows for a dynamical change of the beam attenuation as a function of the photon flux received by XPAD S140 photon counting detector. The system performs a cyclic real-time estimation of the flux received by every pixel during acquisition of an image and searches for clusters of at least two pixels that exceed user defined levels of counts/s. The beam attenuation is immediately and automatically changed in order to guarantee that the detector will always operate in its linear range even during a long continuous scan, by acting on the direct attenuators.}

abstract = {Lithium ion batteries are the dominant form of energy storage in mobile devices, increasingly employed in transportation, and likely candidates for renewable energy storage and integration into the electrical grid. To fulfil their powerful potential, electrodes with increased capacity, faster charge rates, and longer cycle life must be developed. Understanding the mechanics and chemistry of individual nanoparticles under in situ conditions is a crucial step to improving performance and mitigating damage. Here we reveal three-dimensional strain evolution within a single nanoparticle of a promising high voltage cathode material, LiNi<inf>0.5</inf>Mn<inf>1.5</inf>O<inf>4</inf>, under in situ conditions. The particle becomes disconnected during the second charging cycle. This is attributed to the formation of a cathode electrolyte interphase layer with slow ionic conduction. The three-dimensional strain pattern within the particle is independent of cell voltage after disconnection, indicating that the particle is unable to redistribute lithium within its volume or to its neighbours. Understanding the disconnection process at the single particle level and the equilibrium or non-equilibrium state of nanoparticles is essential to improving performance of current and future electrochemical energy storage systems.},

These nanoparticles feature well-defined faceting, offering the possibility to extract structural information as a function of facet orientation and compare it to theoretical simulations. Using Bragg Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging, the uniformity of electrochemically synthesized model catalysts is studied, here high-index faceted tetrahexahedral (THH) platinum nanoparticles at ambient conditions. 3D images of an individual nanoparticle are obtained, assessing not only its shape but also the specific components of the displacement and strain fields both at the surface of the nanocrystal and inside. The study reveals structural diversity of shapes and defects, and shows that the THH platinum nanoparticles present strain build-up close to facets and edges. A facet recognition algorithm is further applied to the imaged nanoparticles and provides facet-dependent structural information for all measured nanoparticles. In the context of strain engineering for model catalysts, this study provides insight into the shape-controlled synthesis of platinum nanoparticles with high-index facets.},
annote = {sample several (tens of) nanoparticles, improve the statistical relevance of the results, and reveal heterogeneities in strain, faceting, and defects. This allows providing statistics to iden- tify dominant facet characteristics, while also finding deviations from the overall trend. The phase $\phi$ obtained by phase retrieval is related to the displacement of lattice points compared to the perfect lattice by the formula $\phi$ (r) = - Ghkl.u(r) + $\phi$0. For convenience, Ghkl was aligned after phase retrieval along the vertical axis z of the reference frame, so that $\phi$(r) = -‖Ghkl‖uz(r) + $\phi$0. The unknown offset $\phi$0 is often chosen such that the phase is null at the COM of the reconstructed modulus. It is therefore important to understand the reconstructed displacement as a displacement relative to the origin of phases. The strain component $\epsilon$zz is obtained as the gradient of the displacement
For nanoparticles 5 and 6, we excluded from the strain estimation the facets orthogonal to
the measurement direction: our measurement is not sensitive
to the surface relaxation in this facet geometry and the cosine
of the facet's angle with the measurement direction is close to
0, resulting in large error bars. 0.1\% is small 
The algorithm allows detecting a crystal's facet using the density of normals of each triangle of the surface mesh of the reconstruction. The surface normals point towards the same direction in the case of a facet; there- fore the local density of surface normals is large at that point. On contrary, if the surface is very rough, normals point in dif- ferent directions and the density is small (see},

Multimetallic nanomaterials serve as state-of-the-art electrocatalysts as a consequence of their unique physico-chemical properties. One method of enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of multimetallic nanomaterials is to tune or control the surface strain of the nanomaterials, and tremendous progress has been made in this area in the past decade. In this Review, we summarize advances in the introduction, tuning and quantification of strain in multimetallic nanocrystals to achieve more efficient energy conversion by electrocatalysis. First, we introduce the concept of strain and its correlation with other key physico-chemical properties. Then, using the electrocatalytic reduction of oxygen as a model reaction, we discuss the underlying mechanisms behind the strain-adsorption-reactivity relationship based on combined classical theories and models. We describe how this knowledge can be harnessed to design multimetallic nanocrystals with optimized strain to increase the efficiency of oxygen reduction. In particular, we highlight the unexpectedly beneficial (and previously overlooked) role of tensile strain from multimetallic nanocrystals in improving electrocatalysis. We conclude by outlining the challenges and offering our perspectives on the research directions in this burgeoning field.},

Here, we report high-lattice distortion at edges of Pt nanocrystals during heterogeneous catalytic methane oxidation based on in situ 3D Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging. We directly observe contraction at edges owing to adsorption of oxygen. This strain increases during methane oxidation and it returns to the original state after completing the reaction process.

Reaction mechanisms obtained from in situ strain imaging thus provide important insights for improving catalysts and designing future nanostructured catalytic materials.},

We report the facet-resolved, surface strain state of a single PtRh alloy nanoparticle on SrTiO3 determined by coherent x-ray diffraction imaging under catalytic reaction conditions. Density functional theory calculations allow us to correlate the facet surface strain state to its reaction environment–dependent chemical composition. We find that the initially Pt-terminated nanoparticle surface gets Rh-enriched under CO oxidation reaction conditions. The local composition is facet orientation dependent, and the Rh enrichment is nonreversible under subsequent CO reduction. Tracking facet-resolved strain and composition under operando conditions is crucial for a rational design of more efficient heterogeneous catalysts with tailored activity, selectivity, and lifetime.}}

When two or more non-parallel facets are present, both the crystal orientation and the crystal facets can be identified. This enables facets to be rapidly indexed and uncommon facets, and planar defects, that have been difficult to study before to be identified. We demonstrate the technique with (i) epitaxial core-shell InGaN/GaN multiple quantum-wells grown on GaN nanowires, where surface facets and planar defects are determined, and (ii) single randomly oriented highly faceted tetrahedrahexal Pt nanoparticles.

However, BCDI relies on both dataset collection and phase retrieval algorithms that can induce artefacts in the reconstruction. Phase retrieval algorithms are based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT). We demonstrate how to calculate the displacement field inside a nanocrystal from its reconstructed phase depending on the mathematical convention used for the FFT. We use numerical simulations to quantify the influence of experimentally unavoidable detector deficiencies such as blind areas or limited dynamic range as well as post-processing filtering on the reconstruction. We also propose a criterion for the isosurface determination of the object, based on the histogram of the reconstructed modulus. Finally, we study the capability of the phasing algorithm to quantitatively retrieve the surface strain (i.e., the strain of the surface voxels). This work emphasizes many aspects that have been neglected so far in BCDI, which need to be understood for a quantitative analysis of displacement and strain based on this technique. It concludes with the optimization of experimental parameters to improve throughput and to establish BCDI as a reliable 3D nano-imaging technique.},

   abstract = {Coherent X-ray diffraction imaging is a rapidly advancing form of microscopy: diffraction patterns, measured using the latest third-generation synchrotron radiation sources, can be inverted to obtain full three-dimensional images of the interior density within nanocrystals. Diffraction from an ideal crystal lattice results in an identical copy of this continuous diffraction pattern at every Bragg peak. This symmetry is broken by the presence of strain fields, which arise from the epitaxial contact forces that are inevitable whenever nanocrystals are prepared on a substrate. When strain is present, the diffraction copies at different Bragg peaks are no longer identical and contain additional information, appearing as broken local inversion symmetry about each Bragg point. Here we show that one such pattern can nevertheless be inverted to obtain a 'complex' crystal density, whose phase encodes a projection of the lattice deformation. A lead nanocrystal was crystallized in ultrahigh vacuum from a droplet on a silica substrate and equilibrated close to its melting point. A three-dimensional image of the density, obtained by inversion of the coherent X-ray diffraction, shows the expected facetted morphology, but in addition reveals a real-space phase that is consistent with the three-dimensional evolution of a deformation field arising from interfacial contact forces. Quantitative three-dimensional imaging of lattice strain on the nanometre scale will have profound consequences for our fundamental understanding of grain interactions and defects in crystalline materials. Our method of measuring and inverting diffraction patterns from nanocrystals represents a vital step towards the ultimate goal of atomic resolution single-molecule imaging that is a prominent justification for development of X-ray free-electron lasers. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

   abstract = {The effects of dynamical diffraction in single crystals engender many unique diffraction phenomena that cannot be interpreted by the kinematical-diffraction theory, yet knowledge of them is vital to resolving a vast variety of scientific problems ranging from crystal optics to strain measurements in crystalline specimens. Although the fundamental dynamical-diffraction theory was established decades ago, modeling it remains a challenge in a general case wherein the crystal has complex boundaries and mixed diffraction geometries (Bragg or Laue). Here, we propose a universal approach for modeling x-ray dynamical diffraction from a single crystal with arbitrary shape and strain field that is based on the integral representation of the Takagi-Taupin equations. Using it, we can construct the solution iteratively via a converging series, independent of the diffraction geometry. Moreover, the integral equations offer additional insights into the diffraction physics that are not readily apparent in its differential counterparts. To demonstrate this approach, we studied the dynamical diffraction from a slab of single crystal with both Bragg and Laue diffraction excited on the entrance boundaries, a problem that is difficult to model by other methods. We also explored the mirage effect caused by the presence of a linear strain field and compared it to the Eikonal theory. Lastly, we derived a dynamical-diffraction equation correlating the structural properties of a particle to its far-field Bragg-diffraction pattern, shedding light on how dynamical diffraction affects these kinematical-diffraction-based inverse techniques for reconstructing the shape and the strain field. © 2014 American Physical Society.},

At the dynamical diffraction limit, the reconstructed shape is no longer correct, as a result of the strong extinction effect.

Probing the three-dimensional (3D) lattice strains that govern their interactions remains a challenge. Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) allows strain to be measured with nanoscale 3D resolution. However, it is currently limited to materials that form microcrystals. Here we introduce a technique that allows the manufacture of BCDI samples from bulk materials. Using tungsten as an example, we show that focused ion-beam machining can be used to extract, from macroscopic crystals, micron-sized BCDI samples containing specific preselected defects. To interpret the experimental data, we develop a displacement-gradient-based analysis for multireflection BCDI. This allows accurate recovery of the full lattice strain tensor from samples containing multiple dislocations. These capabilities open the door to BCDI as a microscopy tool for studying complex real-world materials.},

Typical phase retrieval algorithms are iterative in nature, and hence, are time-consuming and computationally expensive, making real-time imaging a challenge. Furthermore, iterative phase retrieval algorithms struggle to converge to the correct solution especially in the presence of strong phase structures. In this work, we demonstrate the training and testing of CDI NN, a pair of deep deconvolutional networks trained to predict structure and phase in real space of a 2D object from its corresponding far-field diffraction intensities alone. Once trained, CDI NN can invert a diffraction pattern to an image within a few milliseconds of compute time on a standard desktop machine, opening the door to real-time imaging.},

In this work, we explore the quantification of surface structural features and establish a database of atomic strain distributions for the late-transition metal HIF nanoparticle models.

We test the descriptor with four different adsorbates on four active sites of two metals, and applying strain in the range of ±3 \%, usually observed experimentally at catalytic metal surfaces. Furthermore, we use the descriptor to illustrate catalyst design availing strain and nearest-neighbor effects simultaneously for the oxygen reduction reaction, a reaction of high importance in fuel cells. The connection between coordination and strain helps in the search for robust yet rapid catalyst design methodologies.},

As Pt nanoparticles are normally used to maximize catalyst utilization and to minimize catalyst loading, it is important to rationalize and predict catalytic activity trends in nanoparticles in simple terms, while being able to compare these trends with those of extended surfaces. The trends in the adsorption energies of small oxygen- and hydrogen-containing adsorbates on Pt nanoparticles of various sizes and on extended surfaces were analyzed through DFT calculations by making use of the generalized coordination numbers of the surface sites. This simple and predictive descriptor links the geometric arrangement of a surface to its adsorption properties. It generates linear adsorption-energy trends, captures finite-size effects, and provides more accurate descriptions than d-band centers and usual coordination numbers. Unlike electronic-structure descriptors, which require knowledge of the densities of states, it is calculated manually. Finally, it was shown that an approximate equivalence exists between generalized coordination numbers and d-band centers.},

Metals constitute a wide class of catalysts, and because catalysis occurs on the surface, there is an economic incentive, especially for precious metals, to obtain catalysts in the form of small metal particles. This, however, raises two main problems. One is fundamental in nature and addresses the question as to below which particle size the metallic properties are lost. The other is more practical and concerns the preparation and characterization of very small particles and their catalytic activity. The other problem concerns the practical ways of producing metals with particle sizes around the critical value calculated above. The easiest and most practical way to achieve this goal is to deposit the metal in low concentration on a high-surface-area support. The main purpose of using a carrier is, of course, to achieve a high dispersion of the metal and to stabilize it against sintering. In a number of reactions, however, the metal support is not inert and the overall process is actually a combination of two functions: that of the metal and that of the catalytically active support.}

abstract={An overview of recent advancements in density functional theory modeling of particularly reactive sites at noble and late transition metal surfaces is given. Such special sites include sites at the flat surfaces of thin metal films, sites at stepped surfaces, sites at the metal/oxide interface boundary for oxide-supported metal clusters, and sites at the perimeter of oxide islands grown on metal surfaces. The Newns--Anderson model of the electronic interaction underlying chemisorption is described. This provides the grounds for introducing the Hammer--N{\o}rskov d-band model that correlates changes in the energy center of the valence d-band density of states at the surface sites with their ability to form chemisorption bonds. A reactivity change described by this model is characterized as an electronic structure effect. Br{\o}nsted plots of energy barriers versus reaction energies are discussed from the surface reaction perspective and are used to analyze the trends in the calculated changes. Deviations in the relation between energy barriers and reaction energies in Br{\o}nsted plots are identified as due to atomic structure effects. The reactivity change from pure Pd surfaces to Pd thin films supported on MgO can be assigned to an electronic effect. Likewise for the reactivity change from flat Au surfaces, over Au thin films to Au edges and the Au/MgO interface boundary. The reactivity enhancement at atomic step sites is of both electronic and atomic structure nature for NO dissociation at Ru, Rh and Pd surfaces. The enhancement of the CO oxidation reactivity when moving from a CO+O coadsorption structure on Pt(111) to the PtO2 oxide island edges supported by Pt(111) is, however, identified as mainly an atomic structure effect. As such, it is linked to the occurrence of favorable pathways at the oxide island edges and is occurring despite of stronger adsorbate binding of the oxygen within the oxide edge, i.e. despite of an opposing electronic effect. As a final topic, a discussion is given of the accuracy of density functional theory in conjunction with surface reactions; adsorption, desorption, diffusion, and dissociation. Energy barriers are concluded to be more robust with respect to changes in the exchange-correlation functional than are molecular bond and adsorption energies.},

The inertness of gold does not reflect a general inability to form chemical bonds, however---gold forms very stable alloys with many other metals. To understand the nobleness of gold, we have studied a simple surface reaction, the dissociation of H2 on the surface of gold and of three other metals (copper, nickel and platinum) that lie close to it in the periodic table. We present self-consistent density-functional calculations of the activation barriers and chemisorption energies which clearly illustrate that nobleness is related to two factors: the degree of filling of the antibonding states on adsorption, and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate. These two factors, which determine both the strength of the adsorbate-metal interaction and the energy barrier for dissociation, operate together to the maxima] detriment of adsorbate binding and subsequent reactivity on gold.},

ABSTRACT = {Volatile organic compound (VOC) abatement has become imperative nowadays due to their harmful effect on human health and on the environment. Catalytic oxidation has appeared as an innovative and promising approach, as the pollutants can be totally oxidized at moderate operating temperatures under 500 &deg;C. The most active single oxides in the total oxidation of hydrocarbons have been shown to be manganese and cobalt oxides. The main factors affecting the catalytic performances of several metal-oxide catalysts, including CoOx and MnOx, in relation to the total oxidation of hydrocarbons have been reviewed. The influence of these factors is directly related to the Mars&ndash;van Krevelen mechanism, which is known to be applied in the case of the oxidation of VOCs in general and hydrocarbons in particular, using transitional metal oxides as catalysts. The catalytic behaviors of the studied oxides could be closely related to their redox properties, their nonstoichiometric, defective structure, and their lattice oxygen mobility. The control of the structural and textural properties of the studied metal oxides, such as specific surface area and specific morphology, plays an important role in catalytic applications. A fundamental challenge in the development of efficient and low-cost catalysts is to choose the criteria for selecting them. Therefore, this research could be useful for tailoring advanced and high-performance catalysts for the total oxidation of VOCs.},

@article{Lauraux2020,
abstract = {Multi-wavelength (mw) Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging (BCDI) is demonstrated on a single Au particle. The multi-wavelength Bragg diffraction patterns are inverted using conventional phase-retrieval algorithms where the dilation of the effective pixel size of a pixelated 2D detector caused by the variation of the X-ray beam energy is mitigated by interpolating the raw data. The reconstructed Bragg electron density and phase field are in excellent agreement with the results obtained from conventional rocking scans of the same particle. Voxel sizes of about 63 nm3 are obtained for reconstructions from both approaches. Phase shifts as small as 0.41 rad, which correspond to displacements of 14 pm and translate into strain resolution better than 10-4 in the Au particle, are resolved. The displacement field changes shape during the experiment, which is well reproduced by finite element method simulations considering an inhomogeneous strained carbon layer deposited on the Au particle over the course of the measurements. These experiments thus demonstrate the very high sensitivity of BCDI and mw-BCDI to strain induced by contaminations. Furthermore, mw-BCDI offers new opportunities for in situ and operando 3D strain imaging in complex sample environments.},

@article{Newton2010,
abstract = {Nanoscale structures can be highly strained because of confinement effects and the strong influence of their external boundaries. This results in dramatically different electronic, magnetic and optical material properties of considerable utility. Third-generation synchrotron-based coherent X-ray diffraction has emerged as a non-destructive tool for three-dimensional(3D) imaging of strain and defects in crystals that are smaller than the coherence volume, typically a few cubic micrometres, of the available beams that have sufficient flux to reveal the materials structure1. Until now, measurements have been possible only at a single Bragg point of a given crystal beause of the limited ability to maintain alignment2; it has therefore been possible to determine only one component of displacement and not the full strain tensor. Here we report key advances in our fabrication and experimental techniques, which have enabled diffraction patterns to be obtained from six Bragg reflections of the same ZnO nanocrystal for the first time. All three Cartesian components of the ion displacement field, and in turn the full nine-component strain tensor, have thereby been imaged in three dimensions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

   abstract = {Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI), a technique where an object is reconstructed from a single (2D or 3D) diffraction pattern, recovers the lost diffraction phases without a priori knowledge of the extent (support) of the object. The uncertainty of the object support can lead to over-fitting and prevents an unambiguous metric evaluation of solutions. We propose to use a 'free' log-likelihood indicator, where a small percentage of points are masked from the reconstruction algorithms, as an unbiased metric to evaluate the validity of computed solutions, independent of the sample studied. We also show how a set of solutions can be analysed through an eigen-decomposition to yield a better estimate of the real object. Example analysis on experimental data is presented both for a test pattern dataset, and the diffraction pattern from a live cyanobacteria cell. The method allows the validation of reconstructions on a wide range of materials (hard condensed or biological), and should be particularly relevant for 4th generation synchrotrons and X-ray free electron lasers, where large, high-throughput datasets require a method for unsupervised data evaluation.},

Here, we report three-dimensional (3D) imaging of single gold nanoparticles during catalysis of ascorbic acid decomposition using Bragg coherent diﬀractive imaging (BCDI). Local strains were measured in single nanoparticles and modeled using reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) simulations and ﬁnite element analysis (FEA) simulations. RMD reveals the pathway for local strain generation in the gold lattice: chemisorption of hydroxyl ions. FEA reveals that the RMD results are transferable to the nanocrystal sizes studied in the experiment. Our study probes the strain-activity connection and opens a powerful avenue for theoretical and experimental studies of nanocrystal catalysis.},

The transfocator can be used with other monochromators and/or other focusing elements, leading to significant increases in flux. Furthermore, the chromatic nature of the focusing means the transfocator suppresses harmonics and can also be used as an extremely high flux broad-band-pass monochromator.

This method relies on a combination of several state-of-the-art techniques: coherent x-ray diffraction used as a local probe, together with the controlled compression of micro-objects. We demonstrate that by using this method, dislocations in the microcrystal can be detected and their number precisely quantified. This cannot be done with other techniques in a nondestructive way. Our method opens a route for the study of many small-scale systems with defect-dependent physical properties and it could become a critical tool for addressing future challenges in nanotechnology.},

Three platinum oxide phases were found: the hexagonal alpha-PtO2, already described in the literature, a new phase, $\beta$-PtO2 (CaCl2 structure), and Pt3O4 (NaxPt3O4 structure). $\beta$-PtO2 andPt3O4 are black, highly insoluble solids, which can be easily synthesized in bulk at high oxygen pressures. The tetragonal PtO phase reported by Moore and Pauling was not encountered in this study and neither was the b.c.c. Pt3O4 found by Galloni and Roffo. In the system Rh-O we found (besides the already-known, two Rh2O3 polymorphs) a new RhO2 phase with the rutile structure. RhO2 is a black, easily synthesized solid, which is highly insoluble even in hot aqua regia. “Goldschmidt radii” were derived for Pt4+ and Rh4+ and found to be 0.66 Å and 0.64 Å, respectively.}

This imaging approach has become especially important recently due to advent of X-ray Free-Electron Lasers (XFEL) and its applications to the fast developing technique of serial X-ray crystallography. We start with the basic description of coherent scattering on the finite size crystals. The difference between conventional crystallography applied to large samples and coherent scattering on the finite size samples is outlined. The formalism of coherent scattering from a finite size crystal with a strain field is considered. Partially coherent illumination of a crystalline sample is developed. Recent experimental examples demonstrating applications of CXDI to the study of crystalline structures on the nanoscale, including experiments at FELs, are also presented.},

   title = {When holography meets coherent diffraction imaging},
   volume = {20},
   doi = {10.1364/OE.20.028871},
   abstract = {The phase problem is inherent to crystallographic, astronomical and optical imaging where only the intensity of the scattered signal is detected and the phase information is lost and must somehow be recovered to reconstruct the object’s structure. Modern imaging techniques at the molecular scale rely on utilizing novel coherent light sources like X-ray free electron lasers for the ultimate goal of visualizing such objects as individual biomolecules rather than crystals. Here, unlike in the case of crystals where structures can be solved by model building and phase refinement, the phase distribution of the wave scattered by an individual molecule must directly be recovered. There are two well-known solutions to the phase problem: holography and coherent diffraction imaging (CDI). Both techniques have their pros and cons. In holography, the reconstruction of the scattered complex-valued object wave is directly provided by a well-defined reference wave that must cover the entire detector area which often is an experimental challenge. CDI provides the highest possible, only wavelength limited, resolution, but the phase recovery is an iterative process which requires some pre-defined information about the object and whose outcome is not always uniquely-defined. Moreover, the diffraction patterns must be recorded under oversampling conditions, a pre-requisite to be able to solve the phase problem. Here, we report how holography and CDI can be merged into one superior technique: holographic coherent diffraction imaging (HCDI). An inline hologram can be recorded by employing a modified CDI experimental scheme. We demonstrate that the amplitude of the Fourier transform of an inline hologram is related to the complex-valued visibility, thus providing information on both, the amplitude and the phase of the scattered wave in the plane of the diffraction pattern. With the phase information available, the condition of oversampling the diffraction patterns can be relaxed, and the phase problem can be solved in a fast and unambiguous manner. We demonstrate the reconstruction of various diffraction patterns of objects recorded with visible light as well as with low-energy electrons. Although we have demonstrated our HCDI method using laser light and low-energy electrons, it can also be applied to any other coherent radiation such as X-rays or high-energy electrons.},

We have succeeded in using these coherent beams to study the strain field arising from individual misfit dislocations located at an interface between a GeSi thin film and its Si(001) substrate.

In practice this means growing epitaxial semiconductor layers on substrates often greatly differing in lattice parameters and thermal expansion coefficients. With increasing layer thickness the relaxation of misfit and thermal strains may cause dislocations, substrate bowing and even layer cracking. Minimizing these drawbacks is therefore essential for heterostructures based on thick layers to be of any use for device fabrication. Here we prove by scanning X-ray nanodiffraction that mismatched Ge crystals epitaxially grown on deeply patterned Si substrates evolve into perfect structures away from the heavily dislocated interface. We show that relaxing thermal and misfit strains result just in lattice bending and tiny crystal tilts. We may thus expect a new concept in which continuous layers are replaced by quasi-continuous crystal arrays to lead to dramatically improved physical properties.},

Beam sizes down to about one µm are routinely used and sub-µm beam sizes are becoming available. Scanning diffractometry can be used to examine samples like single fibres without the necessity for sectioning, as is required for transmission electron scattering experiments. Examples are taken principally from weakly scattering polymers and biopolymers. In single-crystal diffraction, sub-µm3 crystal volumes have been reached for inorganic crystals. Protein crystallography has been demonstrated for a few tenths of µm linear crystal size, which reduces the crystallization time for many proteins.},

The results of the theory developed are found to be in very good agreement with atomistic simulations and experiments.},

Although single-nanometre resolutions in various hard-X-ray analytical methods are theoretically possible with a focused hard-X-ray beam, fabrication of the focusing optics remains the main hurdle. Aberrations owing to imperfections in the optical system degrade the quality of the focused beam(1). Here, we describe an in situ wavefront-correction approach to overcome this and demonstrate an X-ray beam focused in one direction to a width of 7 nm at 20 keV. We achieved focal spot improvement of the X-ray nanobeam produced by a laterally graded multilayer mirror(2). A grazing-incidence deformable mirror(3) was used to restore the wavefront shape. Using this system, ideal focusing conditions are achievable even if hard-X-ray focusing elements do not achieve sufficient performance. It is believed that this will ultimately lead to single-nanometre spatial resolution in X-ray analytical methods.},

material for Si-compatible laser applications. The band structure of
unstrained Ge exhibits indirect conduction band valleys (L) lower than the
direct valley (Γ) by 136 meV. Adequate strain and n-type doping
engineering can effectively provide population inversion in the direct
bandgap of Ge. The tensile strain decreases the difference between the L
valleys and the Γ valley, while the extrinsic electrons from n-type doping
fill the L valleys to the level of the Γ valley to compensate for the remaining
energy difference. Our modeling shows that with a combination of 0.25\%
tensile strain and an extrinsic electron density of 7.6×1019/cm3 by n-type
doping, a net material gain of {\textasciitilde}400 cm-1 can be obtained from the direct gap transition of Ge despite of the free carrier absorption loss. The threshold current density for lasing is estimated to be {\textasciitilde}6kA cm-2 for a typical edgeemitting double heterojunction structure. These results indicate that tensile strained n-type Ge is a good candidate for Si integrated lasers.},

Using this image it is possible to identify particular islands and select them for analysis one by one. The Ge and strain distribution within each island is obtained from the intensity distribution in reciprocal space measured for several individual islands. The detailed shape of each measured island is obtained from scanning electron microscopy. Apart from truncated pyramid-shaped islands, we detect and characterize a small number of flat islands and show that they represent an earlier growth stage of the pyramidal shaped ones.

abstract={Atmospheric nitrous oxide concentrations have been increasing since the industrial revolution and currently account for 6{\%} of total anthropogenic radiative forcing. Microbial production in soils is the dominant nitrous oxide source; this has increased with increasing use of nitrogen fertilizers. However, fertilizer use alone cannot account for the historical trends of atmospheric concentrations of nitrous oxide. Here, I analyse atmospheric concentrations, industrial sources of nitrous oxide, and fertilizer and manure production since 1860. Before 1960, agricultural expansion, including livestock production, may have caused globally significant mining of soil nitrogen, fuelling a steady increase in atmospheric nitrous oxide. After 1960, the rate of the increase rose, due to accelerating use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. Using a regression model, I show that 2.0{\%} of manure nitrogen and 2.5{\%} of fertilizer nitrogen was converted to nitrous oxide between 1860 and 2005; these percentage contributions explain the entire pattern of increasing nitrous oxide concentrations over this period. Consideration of processes that re-concentrate soil nitrogen, such as manure production by livestock, improved `hind-casting' of nitrous oxide emissions. As animal protein consumption in human diets increases globally, management of manure will be an important component of future efforts to reduce anthropogenic nitrous oxide sources.},

   abstract = {The texture of a cube-oriented Ni single crystal after one-pass equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) was measured globally and locally by neutron and synchrotron radiation, respectively. The texture is characterized by a TD rotated cube, a split C component and a partial B fiber. These components are heterogeneously distributed in the ECAP billet. Due to friction at the die walls, the rotated cube is mainly observed in the top and bottom parts of the billet, the split C dominates in the central part. The experimental results with respect to component intensity, position from ideal orientation and asymmetry of component splitting are compared with texture simulations taking into account grain fragmentation. Conclusions concerning polycrystal deformation are drawn.},

This thesis explores the framework of the very promising implementation of ptychography called the Ptychographic Iterative Engine (PIE).  The PIE algorithm provides an elegant solution to the phase problem that facilitates recovery of complex representations of both the illuminating wave and the object of interest.  The aim of this thesis is to present work done on the study of the machinery behind the PIE algorithm.  This thesis formulates the solution provided by the PIE algorithm in reciprocal space; this shows the exact minimisation routine implemented by the PIE update function and provides a unified framework for quantifying the performance of the PIE algorithm.
This work is timely because it highlights aspects of the PIE algorithm that permits practical implementation of bandwidth extrapolation of a specimen from a small detector and demonstrates the uniqueness of the corresponding solution provided by the PIE algorithm.  This thesis also presents a viable scheme that utilises the redundancy of the ptychographic dataset to greatly reduce the sampling requirement on the detector; thus optimising the dataset size employed in real-time high-resolution reconstruction of the specimen over a wide field of view.},

   title = {Coherent {X}-ray diffraction imaging of zinc oxide crystals},
   copyright = {open},
   abstract = {Zinc Oxide (ZnO) exhibits a plethora of physical properties potentially advantageous in
many roles and is why it one of the most studied semiconductor compounds. When doped
or in its intrinsic state ZnO demonstrates a multitude of electronic, optical and magnetic
properties in a large variety of manufacturable morphologies. Thus it is inherently important
to understand why these properties arise and the impact potentially invasive sample
preparation methods have for both the function and durability of the material and its
devices.
Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging (CXDI) is a recently established non-destructive technique
which can probe the whole three dimensional structure of small crystalline materials
and has the potential for sub angstrom strain resolution. The iterative methods employed
to overcome the `phase problem' are described fully.
CXDI studies of wurtzite ZnO crystals in the rod morphology with high aspect ratio are
presented. ZnO rods synthesised via Chemical Vapour Transport Deposition were studied
in post growth state and during in-situ modification via metal evaporation processing and
annealing. Small variations in post growth state were observed, the physical origin of
which remains unidentified. The doping of a ZnO crystal with Iron, Nickel and Cobalt
by thermal evaporation and subsequent annealing was studied. The evolution of diffusing
ions into the crystal lattice from was not observed, decomposition was found to be the
dominant process.
Improvements in experimental technique allowed multiple Bragg reflections from a single ZnO crystal to be measured for the first time. Large aspect ratio ZnO rods were used to
probe the coherence properties of the incident beam. The longitudinal coherence function
of the illuminating radiation was mapped using the visibility of the interference pattern
at each bragg reflection and an accurate estimate of the longitudinal coherence length
obtained, {\textbackslash}xi(L) = 0.66{\textbackslash}pm 0.02 {\textbackslash}mu m. The consequences for data analysis are discussed. The
combination of multiple Bragg reflections to realise three dimensional displacement fields
was also approached.},

This results in dramatically different electronic, magnetic and optical material properties of considerable utility. Third-generation synchrotron-based coherent X-ray diffraction has emerged as a non-destructive tool for three-dimensional (3D) imaging of strain and defects in crystals that are smaller than the coherence volume, typically a few cubic micrometres, of the available beams that have sufficient flux to reveal the material’s structure. Until now, measurements have been possible only at a single Bragg point of a given crystal because of the limited ability to maintain alignment; it has therefore been possible to determine only one component of displacement and not the full strain tensor. Here we report key advances in our fabrication and experimental techniques, which have enabled diffraction patterns to be obtained from six Bragg reflections of the same ZnO nanocrystal for the first time. All three Cartesian components of the ion displacement field, and in turn the full nine-component strain tensor, have thereby been imaged in three dimensions.},

   doi = {10.1103/PhysRevB.82.165436},
   abstract = {An important application of phase retrieval methods is to invert coherent x-ray diffraction measurements to obtain real-space images of nanoscale crystals. The phase information is currently recovered from reciprocal-space amplitude measurements by the application of iterative projective algorithms that solve the nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problem. Various algorithms have been developed each of which apply constraints in real and reciprocal space on the reconstructed object. In general, these methods rely on experimental data that is oversampled above the Nyquist frequency. To date, support-based methods have worked well, but are less successful for highly strained structures, defined as those which contain (real-space) phase information outside the range of ±π/2. As a direct result the acquired experimental data is, in general, inadvertently subsampled below the Nyquist frequency. In recent years, a new theory of “compressive sensing” has emerged, which dictates that an appropriately subsampled (or compressed) signal can be recovered exactly through iterative reconstruction and various routes to minimizing the ℓ1 norm or total variation in that signal. This has proven effective in solving several classes of convex optimization problems. Here we report on a “density-modification” phase reconstruction algorithm that applies the principles of compressive sensing to solve the nonconvex phase retrieval problem for highly strained crystalline materials. The application of a nonlinear operator in real-space minimizes the ℓ1 norm of the amplitude by a promotion-penalization (or “propenal”) operation that confines the density bandwidth. This was found to significantly aid in the reconstruction of highly strained nanocrystals. We show how this method is able to successfully reconstruct phase information that otherwise could not be recovered.},

   abstract = {(1) Subcutaneous or intra-abdominal injections of 8 mg of HgCl2/100 g body weight markedly depressed hepatic fatty acid synthetase activity of chicks at 1 h post-injection. The depression occurred despite the fact that the chicks continued to eat up until the time they were killed. Under these same conditions, the hepatic activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.2) was not affected by HgCl2, while the activity of the mitochondrial system of fatty acid elongation was stimulated. (2) When 2-mercaptoethanol was included in the incubation medium for a highly purified preparation of fatty acid synthetase, 500 muM HgCl2 was required to show definite inhibition of the enzyme. When 2-mercaptoethanol was omitted, 50 muM HgCl2 was inhibitory and 100 muM HgCl2 abolished enzyme activity. (3) 2 mM dithiothreitol completely protected the purified fatty acid synthetase preparation from inhibition by 100 muM HgCl2. When dithiothreitol was added after the addition of enzyme to the mercury-containing medium, protection of the enzyme was not complete. (4) Dialysis of cytosol fractions from chicks injected with HgCl2 against 500 vol. of 0.2 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mM EDTA and 10 mM dithiothreitol for 4 h at 4 degrees stimulated the fatty acid synthetase activity of the fractions. Dialysis of cytosol fractions from noninjected chicks under the same conditions was without effect on fatty acid synthetase activity. (5) These data support the hypothesis that the inhibitory effect of HgCl2 administered in vivo on hepatic fatty acid synthetase activity in chicks is mediated through the interaction of mercury with the sulfhydryl groups of the enzyme.},

Here we show that ptychography, applied in the Bragg geometry, opens new perspectives for crystalline imaging. The spatial dependence of the three-dimensional Bragg peak intensity is mapped and the entire data subsequently inverted with a Bragg-adapted phase retrieval ptychographical algorithm. We report on the image obtained from an extended crystalline sample, nanostructured from a silicon-on-insulator substrate. The possibility to retrieve, without transverse size restriction, the highly resolved three-dimensional density and displacement field will allow for the unprecedented investigation of a wide variety of crystalline materials, ranging from life science to microelectronics.},

It is of particular importance for microscopy imaging with diffraction set-ups where high quality lenses are not available. The inversion scheme allowing the phase retrieval is based on the use of an iterative algorithm. In this work, we address the question of the choice of the iterative process in the case of data corrupted by photon or electron shot noise. Several noise models are presented and further used within two inversion strategies, the ordered subset and the scaled gradient. Based on analytical and numerical analysis together with Monte-Carlo studies, we show that any physical interpretations drawn from a CDI iterative technique require a detailed understanding of the relationship between the noise model and the used inversion method. We observe that iterative algorithms often assume implicitly a noise model. For low counting rates, each noise model behaves differently. Moreover, the used optimization strategy introduces its own artefacts. Based on this analysis, we develop a hybrid strategy which works efficiently in the absence of an informed initial guess. Our work emphasises issues which should be considered carefully when inverting experimental data.},

   abstract = {X-ray ptychography is a lensless microscopy method able to provide extended field of view with spatial resolution above the diffraction limit. A series of intensity coherent diffraction patterns measured in the far field is used to obtain the numerical deconvolution between the sample scattering contrast and the illumination function. The measurements are performed with a finite-size beam spot scanned across the sample. The scan step, smaller than the beam size, ensures a high redundancy in the data set, which allows for the convergence of the iterative inversion algorithm. This work explores the possibility to use ptychography for the investigation of strained crystals by means of coherent x-ray Bragg diffraction, taking advantage of the high sensitivity to the atomic displacement fields. The Bragg diffraction scattering contrast is described by an effective complex-valued electron density, where the phase holds the information on the displacement field. The detailed two-dimensional numerical study of Bragg ptychography is presented, both for the known and unknown illumination cases. It demonstrates the high robustness of the ptychographical iterative engine for highly nonhomogeneous strain fields. In particular, the local information is extracted from the individual diffraction patterns to calculate the modulus and phase estimates of the electron density, which are further used to constrain the newly derived algorithm. From this work, it is foreseen that Bragg ptychography when experimentally feasible, will open the way to the nondestructive imaging of strain fields at the nanoscale.},

The upper arrows and one of the lower ones are in the direction of the incident wave or of ko, and the other lower one in that of k h. The solutions at P on the exit surface are determined by the part of the incident wave falling between A and B, and can be calculated either by the method of Riemann functions or by successive numerical calculations at each mesh point. it into second-order partial differential equations for Y'0 and Vh, each of which have a hyperbolic form which is capable of solution by the method of Riemann functions. This method gives the solution at a point P inside or on the exit surface of the crystal by a surface integral over AB (Fig. l) where A and B are points on the entrance surface such that AP and BP are, respectively , parallel to k 0 and kh. The integral involves T0(re) and the Riemann function for this particular point P given by the values of Xh, ~ and fla inside the triangle PAB, and its derivatives. This result is of theoretical importance, since it shows that only values of the amplitude of the incident wave falling between A and B contribute to the wave function at P, providing a theoretical basis for the column approximation in the electron case where the triangle PAB reduces to a thin column owing to the small Bragg angle. Equation (8) is also capable of a numerical solution. It includes only the derivatives ~Vo/~S o and ~a/~Sh out of four possible first-order ones. This shows that if we divide the triangle PAB by a fine mesh with axes parallel to k 0 and ka, as shown in Fig. 1, the value of Y'o at P, say, is determined by the values of V0 and v/h at Q, and that of V'n at P, by those of V0 and ~h at R and so on. The repetition of this process from the top surface AB to the bottom will give the solution at P.},

   abstract = {Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations are performed to study the evolution of interfaces in a model alloy system whose parameters are chosen so as to reproduce the main features of the Cu-Ni system, in particular the asymmetry of diffusion coefficients. Recently, Erdélyi et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 89 165901 (2002) have shown that, in alloy systems forming ideal solid solutions, a large asymmetry can lead to the unexpected transient sharpening of interfaces that were initially flat and diffuse. In the present work we first remove two simplifications made by these authors and we study the consequences on the sharpening and broadening of interfaces during the annealing of a multilayered sample. First, in our diffusion model, atoms migrate by vacancy-assisted jumps instead of direct atom exchanges. Second, we investigate the effect of the initial roughness of interfaces on their evolution during annealing. In addition, we also study the influence of the short-range order that arises from a nonideal solid solution, since the Cu-Ni phase diagram displays a miscibility gap at low temperatures. While we observe that the transient sharpening phenomenon can still take place with a vacancy mechanism in alloys with large diffusional asymmetries, we find that the sharpening amplitude is reduced when short-range order is present and even suppressed when interfaces are initially rough. In the latter case, the in-plane wavelength of the roughness plays a determinant role and we identify a crossover from sharpening to broadening when this wavelength exceeds a threshold value. The practical implications of these effects are discussed.},

This additional dependence is due to the presence of interfacial relaxation in these metallic systems. A Fourier analysis of the strain resulting from (100) sinusoidal composition multilayers allows us to identify the main missing terms in the continuum models that account for these composition gradient effects.

This allows one to predict coherent X-ray diffraction (CXD) patterns in reciprocal space in a polycrystalline specimen. When the sample deforms elastically, the full displacement field can be used to simulate CXD patterns, but it is no longer possible, as soon as plasticity develops within the considered grains. An approximate elastic displacement field, based on a first order Taylor expansion of the elastic deformation field near the center of the grain, is used to extend the predictions in the plastic regime. It is shown that using such a field leads to more realistic CXD patterns and therefore this approach could be useful to interpret coherent diffraction experiments in the future.},

   abstract = {Direct inversion of coherent X-ray diffraction patterns is a powerful method to image strains in individual crystals with a high spatial resolution, less than 10 nm. The possibility to invert the diffraction pattern is in principle ensured by the oversampling of the measurement. In addition, the resolution of the reconstructed object requires the measurement of the intensity distribution as far as possible in reciprocal space. Thus, fulfilling the oversampling and resolution constraints, in 3D, implies very long acquisition times, hardly compatible with the stability of the X-ray synchrotron source or sample. To overcome this problem, we present a method based on partial crossed intensity measurements: it consists in two irregularly spaced intensity measurements taken in two orthogonal directions. This paper demonstrates that partial crossed intensity measurements are in principle sufficient to reconstruct 2D objects using a phase retrieval algorithm. We also describe how such measurements can be achieved in practice for 3D imaging. 3D intensity measurements taken in two orthogonal directions for a 111 Bragg peak of a sub-micrometer Au grain are shown.},

In reciprocal space, facet streaks with thickness fringes were clearly observed in the two-dimensional diffraction patterns, from which the shape and size of the corresponding cross sections of the nanowire could be revealed. Comparison with simulated diffraction patterns exhibited the coherency strain field in the nanowire. During in situ annealing at temperatures which would lead to significant intermixing by volume diffusion in bulk material, according to literature data, a core?shell morphology was preserved; that is, intermixing in the nanowire was pronouncedly decelerated compared to bulk diffusion.},

In this work, we use ab initio molecular dynamics together with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to address the stabilization of GeTe doped with nitrogen and carbon in the amorphous phase. The comparison between the simulation and experimental results allows in-depth understanding of the mechanisms. The inclusion of C and N leads to an increase in high frequency vibrational modes and to a lowering of the boson peak intensity. The reduction of the density of floppy vibrational modes and the computed increase of the mechanical rigidity are responsible for the higher activation energy for crystallization. The mechanism described here could apply more generally to stabilize other Ge-Sb-Te phase change materials and ionocovalent glasses at high temperature.},

Coverage discusses the measurement and analysis of textures, the prediction of polycrystal properties from measured textures and known single crystal properties, and the prediction of the development of texture and the ensuing anisotropic properties during elastic and plastic deformation. It also gives an overview of observed textures in metals, ceramics and rocks. There is a balance between theoretical concepts and experimental techniques. The book addresses several issues. Part I provides tools and describes methods to obtain quantitative data on textures of polycrystals. It should be of interest to experimentalists. Part II emphasizes modeling of deformation and incorporates theoretical concepts of mechanics. Part III illustrates successful applications in engineering and earth sciences.},

In quasi-coherent operation, beam sizes of down to 56nm (FWHM, horizontal direction) can be achieved. Comparing measured Airy-like fringe patterns with simulations, the degree of coherence |{$\mu$}| has been quantified as a function of the secondary source aperture (SSA); the coherence is larger than 50% for SSA sizes below 11{$\mu$}m at hard X-ray energies of 14keV. For an SSA size of 5{$\mu$}m, the degree of coherence has been determined to be 87%.},

The impurity contents of the films and substrates were characterized by both secondary ion mass spectrometry and BS. In all cases, Pd2Si is the only silicide phase detected after vacuum annealing up to 300°C and the growth mechanism is always diffusion limited. The rate of the diffusion was found to differ and the activation energies for Pd2Si formation varied between 0.9 and 1.5 eV. These changes are correlated with the presence of impurities in the deposited palladium and silicon films. Also, sputtered palladium films do not form epitaxial Pd2Si layers on (111) Si substrates as vacuum-deposited palladium films do. The conclusion is that rates of reaction and morphology of Pd2Si layers grown by thermal annealing depend on the deposition system.},

   abstract = {Thin Pd films on (111), (110), (100) and amorphous Si substrates form [001] fiber textured Pd2Si in the temperature range 100°–700°C. The degree of texture is a function of substrate orientation, increasing in the order amorphous Si, (100) Si, (110) Si and (111) Si. Only on the (111) Si substrate is the Pd2Si film epitaxially oriented. Temperature-dependent growth on this orientation can be characterized by [001] textured growth, epitaxial azimuth orientation at the Si interface and progressive layer by layer formation of the mosaic crystal to the thin film surface.

During Pd deposition, rapid non-diffusion-controlled growth of epitaxial Pd2Si on (111) Si occurs at substrate temperatures of 100° and 200°C. An unidentified palladium silicide of low crystallographic symmetry forms during Pd deposition onto a 50°C substrate. The diffusion-controlled growth of Pd2Si on (111) Si follows a t0.5 dependence. The velocity constant is k = 7 × 10-2exp- 29200±800RTcm2/sec

Palladium deposited on 100°C (111) Ge substrates reacts during deposition to form epitaxially oriented Pd2Ge. However, growth of this phase at higher temperatures results in a randomly oriented film. The transformation of Pd2Ge to PdGe is kinetically controlled. After a 15 min anneal at 560°±10°C in N2 only PdGe is detectable on (111) Ge.

The high temperature stability of thin film Pd2Si is controlled by time- temperature kinetics. For a given annealing cycle, the nucleation and growth rates of the PdSi phase are inversely related to the crystalline perfection of Pd2Si. Decreasing transformation rates follow the order (100), (110), (111) Si. formation of thin film Pd2Si occurs by the formation of PdSi and subsequent growth of Si within the PdSi phase. After a 30 min N2 anneal, initial transformation occurs at 735°C on (100) Si, 760°C on (110) Si and 840°C on (111) Si. Extended high temperature annealing produces a two-phase structure of highly twinned and misoriented Si and small PdSi grains that penetrate as much as 3 μm into the Si.},

We conducted in situ synchrotron Laue microdiffraction experiments to map local strain tensors and orientations over polycrystalline thin gold films for different applied biaxial strain states. The experimental results demonstrate stress relaxation to be accompanied by cooperative transport of dislocation density leading to rotational plastic deformation heterogeneities. We propose a disclination model of closed dislocation walls and consider the geometry of transformations corresponding to a Burgers circuit enclosing the multipole disclination configuration. The observed stress-driven rotational deformation of the grain is shown to be described by the change in rotational closure failure associated with a Burgers circuit around the multipole disclination configuration. This concept is further advanced in a non-Euclidian geometry to demonstrate that the observed microrotation is captured by higher-order gradients in a micropolar continuum theory.},

A major effort is underway to develop novel synthetic paths using directly renewable energy (RE) sources to drive industrial processes [1]. With ammonia being the second largest-scale chemical (>150Mtonsy-1) with the top largest chemical process in terms of energy consumption (about 2.5EJ on a world scale), it does not surprise the fast emerging interest to develop new solutions to synthesize NH3 from N2 using RE for the process [2]. Between the various solutions under development, the electrocatalytic conversion of N2 is one of the most attracting and one of the challenging directions is the possibility of N2 and H2O co-electrolysis in very mild conditions, around room temperature and atmospheric pressure [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. This solution also offers attractive possibilities for a distributed production of fertilizers [2].}

The flow stress, and strain rate sensitivity of the flow stress, d log σ/d logϵ, are strong functions of strain rate and Sn grain size. The log σ-log ϵ curve is S-shaped with a region of maximum rate sensitivity at an intermediate strain rate, which increases with decreasing grain size. In this region, superplastic elongations of 1000 \% are observed. Concurrent study of the development of microstructure on a polished surface during deformation confirms that distinct deformation mechanisms are dominant at high and low strain rates. At high rates the dominant mechanism is slip, at low rates, grain boundary sliding. High rate sensitivity is associated with the rapid drop in flow stress occurring at strain rates at which grain boundary sliding becomes an important mode of deformation. This interpretation is consistent with a body of evidence in the literature of high temperature creep.},

   abstract = {The possibility of the rotation of a subgrain with respect to its neighbors as a natural process during recrystallization is analyzed thermodynamically and kinetically. It is found that it is energetically possible if the direction of rotation favors the elimination of low‐angle boundaries over that of high‐angle boundaries, the elimination of twist and asymmetric boundaries over that of the tilt and symmetric boundaries, and the elimination of the large‐area boundaries over that of the small‐area boundaries. Since the rotation direction has two degrees of freedom, there exists a relation between the two degrees of freedom such that directions whose two degrees of freedom fulfill such a relation provide no driving force for rotation. All other directions will supply free energy to rotate in one sense or the opposite. Kinetically one of the following two processes within one boundary can be rate‐controlling: the cooperative movement of dislocations in the boundary, and the cooperative diffusion of vacancies in the lattice. The rotation of a subgrain favors the elimination of one of the boundaries which contributes the largest fraction of driving force and also the largest fraction of resistance. This causes the subgrain to coalesce with the other subgrain separated by this boundary. The estimated time required for one such coalescence compares favorably with the observed rate of subgrain growth in Al.},

abstract = {Unlike for metal catalysts where selective chemisorption probes (H2, O2, CO and N2O) have been successfully applied to count the number of active surface sites and allow determination of TOF values, the analogous situation for oxide catalysts has developed very slowly. The reason for the sluggish development of selective chemisorption probes for oxides is that the same chemisorption probes that work well with metals aren’t compatible with oxides since these chemical probes weakly adsorb on oxides. Methanol, however, is a very reactive molecule that has been found to readily chemisorb on oxides and allows for quantitative determination of the number of active surface sites (Ns). In this mini-review, the determination of the number of active sites by methanol chemisorption is reviewed with examples for pure oxides (one-component oxides), supported oxides (submonolayer, monolayer and above monolayer) and bulk mixed oxides (surface enriched oxide present in submonolayer, monolayer and in excess of monolayer coverages).}

The characteristic feature of this mechanism is that some products of the reaction leave the solid catalysts’ surface with one or more constituents of the catalysts’ lattice. First in this review, the position of this mechanism amongst other ways of catalytic activation will be defined. Then, the experimental evidence for this mechanism will be presented. Some less common reactions running with this mechanism will be discussed in more detail, among them the deoxygenation of nitrocompounds and carboxylic acids. The participation of the lattice components (O, S, Cl, H) in the formation of products leads to a relation of the catalytic activity with the thermodynamic parameters characterizing the catalysts lattice. A proper use of such quantified relation will be also discussed.}

abstract = {The Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP) reactor has been applied to study selectivity-directing factors of the high-temperature NH3 oxidation to NO, N2O, and N2 over commercial knitted Pt and woven Pt–Rh alloy gauzes at 973–1173 K. The unique features of the TAP technique enable investigation of the mechanism of this highly exothermic process under isothermal conditions over catalysts of industrial relevance, and the applicaton of much higher peak pressures as compared to surface science techniques in ultrahigh vacuum. This article focuses on the investigation of primary interactions of NH3 and O2. The overall reaction mechanism was found to be very similar over both Pt and Pt–Rh gauzes. NH3 activation is favored over O2-pretreated gauzes, while the as-received gauzes are virtually inactive for NH3 decomposition to N2. The selectivity to NO primarily depends on the concentration of adsorbed oxygen species. A high ratio of adsorbed O/NHx species favors NO formation, confirming that undesirable secondary reaction paths are minimized at a high O coverage. Besides, our results suggest that the nature of oxygen species influences the distribution of NO and N2 in the product. It is put forward that weakly bounded oxygen species lead to a high NO selectivity, while strongly bounded oxidize NH3 into N2. The interaction of NH3 and NO also contributes to N2 formation, while direct NO decomposition is practically suppressed over the oxidized gauzes. Application of isotopically labeled 15NH3 and high peak pressures were essential for detecting N2O formation during ammonia oxidation. Analysis of secondary interactions of NH3 and NO in the authors' next project is required to further unravel the origins of reaction by-products like N2O and N2.}

   abstract = {The evolution of morphology and internal strain under high pressure fundamentally alters the physical property, structural stability, phase transition and deformation mechanism of materials. Until now, only averaged strain distributions have been studied. Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging is highly sensitive to the internal strain distribution of individual crystals but requires coherent illumination, which can be compromised by the complex high-pressure sample environment. Here we report the successful de-convolution of these effects with the recently developed mutual coherent function method to reveal the three-dimensional strain distribution inside a 400 nm gold single crystal during compression within a diamond-anvil cell. The three-dimensional morphology and evolution of the strain under pressures up to 6.4 GPa were obtained with better than 30 nm spatial resolution. In addition to providing a new approach for high-pressure nanotechnology and rheology studies, we draw fundamental conclusions about the origin of the anomalous compressibility of nanocrystals.},

   abstract = {Coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) and scanning transmission x-ray microscopy (STXM) are two popular microscopy techniques that have evolved quite independently. CDI promises to reach resolutions below 10 nanometers, but the reconstruction procedures put stringent requirements on data quality and sample preparation. In contrast, STXM features straightforward data analysis, but its resolution is limited by the spot size on the specimen. We demonstrate a ptychographic imaging method that bridges the gap between CDI and STXM by measuring complete diffraction patterns at each point of a STXM scan. The high penetration power of x-rays in combination with the high spatial resolution will allow investigation of a wide range of complex mesoscopic life and material science specimens, such as embedded semiconductor devices or cellular networks.},

   abstract = {The authors present a method for the fast and efficient measurement of volumes of reciprocal space by x-ray diffraction using linear and area detectors. The goal of this technique is to obtain a complete overview of the reciprocal space to detect and characterize the nature and orientation of all the phases present. They first explain the detailed procedures and scan strategies required for transforming raw scattering data into three-dimensional maps of reciprocal space and present a complete open-source software package for advanced data processing, analysis, and visualization. Several case studies, chosen to highlight the overall capabilities of the technique, are then introduced. First, thermal diffuse scattering from a monocrystalline Si substrate is characterized by the presence of lines linking diffraction peaks in reciprocal space. Second, a detailed investigation of texture in multiphase thin layers permits us to reveal the unambiguous presence of fiber, axiotaxial, and epitaxial components in oriented films. The visualization of a significant fraction of reciprocal space has allowed us to identify an unexpected metastable phase, which could not be deduced from measurements carried out in the Bragg-Brentano geometry. The technique is then used to study planar defects in nickel silicides formed by solid-state reactions and micro twins in a GaP matrix containing coherent MnP precipitates. Overall, the authors show that the systematic acquisition of significant volumes of reciprocal space permits us to observe behaviors that might otherwise remain undetected when analyses are restricted to typical measurement scans.

Misorientation and trace analysis is performed to investigate the grain boundary distribution in these lines. The results reveal strong variations in texture and grain boundary distribution of the copper lines upon downscaling. Lines of width 1.8 µm exhibit a strong 〈111〉 normal texture and comprise large micron-size grains. Upon downscaling to 180 nm, a \{111\}〈110〉 bi-axial texture has been observed. In contrast, narrower lines of widths 120 and 70 nm reveal sidewall growth of \{111\} grains and a dominant 〈110〉 normal texture. The microstructure in these lines comprises clusters of small grains separated by high angle boundaries in the vicinity of large grains. The fraction of coherent twin boundaries also reduces with decreasing line width.},

The membranes are afterward introduced into a molecular beam epitaxy chamber and overgrown with InAs, resulting in the formation of InAs islands on flat areas and at the top of the Si nanomembranes. A detailed analysis of sample morphology, island structure, and strain is carried out. Scanning electron microscopy shows that the membrane stays intact during overgrowth. Atomic force microscopy reveals a lower island density on top of the freestanding membranes, denoting a modified wetting or diffusivity in these areas. An observed bending of the membrane indicates a strain transfer from the InAs islands to the compliant substrate. X-ray diffraction and finite-element modeling indicate a nonuniform strain state of the island ensemble grown on the freestanding membrane. A simulation of the bending of the nanomembranes indicates that the islands at the center of the freestanding area are highly strained, whereas islands on the border tend to be fully relaxed. Finally, continuum elasticity calculations suggest that for a sufficiently thin membrane InAs could transfer enough strain to the membrane to allow coherent epitaxial growth, something not possible on bulk substrates.},

So far, the materials used in applications have all been in bulk form. In this paper, it is proposed that it may be possible to increase Z of certain materials by preparing them in quantum-well superlattice structures. Calculations have been done to investigate the potential for such an approach, and also to evaluate the effect of anisotropy on the figure of merit. The calculations show that layering has the potential to increase significantly the figure of merit of a highly anisotropic material such as Bi2Te3, provided that the superlattice multilayers are made in a particular orientation. This result opens the possibility of using quantum-well superlattice structures to enhance the performance of thermoelectric coolers.},

Here, we outline an approach to optimize strength and ductility by identifying three essential structural characteristics for boundaries: coherency with surrounding matrix, thermal and mechanical stability, and smallest feature size finer than 100 nanometers. We assess current understanding of strengthening and propose a methodology for engineering coherent, nanoscale internal boundaries, specifically those involving nanoscale twin boundaries. Additionally, we discuss perspectives on strengthening and preserving ductility, along with potential applications for improving failure tolerance, electrical conductivity, and resistance to electromigration.},

Destructive approaches such as scanning and transmission electron microscopy of microsections prepared by focused ion beam, and non-destructive imaging approaches including laser scanning and scanning electron microscopy of pretreated surfaces as well as synchrotron computed tomography techniques (micro- and ptychographic tomographies) were employed for resolving the large, ␮m-sized melt-structures and the ﬁne nano-oxide substructure within the buried interface. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the ﬁne, openporous nano-oxide homogeneously covers the larger macrostructure features which in turn cover the joint surface. The open-porous nano-oxide forming the interface itself appears to be fully inﬁltrated and wetted by the polymer.

RF measurements were performed up to 40 GHz on fabricated switches, showing an ON-state resistance of 1.7 Ω. An OFF-state capacitance of 5.4 fF was extracted from simulation, resulting in an estimated cutoff frequency of 17 THz, which is at the state-of-the-art.

RMC modelling can also be applied to many different types of system - liquids, glasses, polymers, crystals and magnetic materials. This article outlines the RMC method and discusses some of the common misconceptions about it. It is stressed that RMC models are neither unique nor `correct'. However, they are often useful for aiding our understanding either of the structure itself, or of the relationships between local structure and other physical properties. Examples are given and the possibilities for further development of the RMC method are discussed.}

@article{Boulle2019,
abstract = {The Python programming language, combined with the numerical computing library NumPy and the scientific computing library SciPy, has become the de facto standard for scientific computing in a variety of fields. This popularity is mainly due to the ease with which a Python program can be written and executed (easy syntax, dynamical typing, no compilation etc.), coupled with the existence of a large number of specialized third-party libraries that aim to lift all the limitations of the raw Python language. NumPy introduces vector programming, improving execution speeds, whereas SciPy brings a wealth of highly optimized and reliable scientific functions. There are cases, however, where vector programming alone is not sufficient to reach optimal performance. This issue is addressed with dedicated compilers that aim to translate Python code into native and statically typed code with support for the multi-core architectures of modern processors. In the present article it is shown how these approaches can be efficiently used to tackle different problems, with increasing complexity, that are relevant to crystallography: the 2D Laue function, scattering from a strained 2D crystal, scattering from 3D nanocrystals and, finally, diffraction from films and multilayers. For each case, detailed implementations and explanations of the functioning of the algorithms are provided. Different Python compilers (namely NumExpr, Numba, Pythran and Cython) are used to improve performance and are benchmarked against state-of-the-art NumPy implementations. All examples are also provided as commented and didactic Python (Jupyter) notebooks that can be used as starting points for crystallographers curious to enter the Python ecosystem or wishing to accelerate their existing codes.},

Although ideal planar IDBs are well documented, the understanding of their conﬁgurations and interactions inside crystals relies on perfect-interface assumptions. Here, we report on the microscopic conﬁguration of IDBs inside n-doped gallium nitride wires revealed by coherent X-ray Bragg imaging. Complex IDB conﬁgurations are evidenced with 6 nm resolution and the absolute polarity of each domain is unambiguously identiﬁed. Picoscale displacements along and across the wire are directly extracted from several Bragg reﬂections using phase retrieval algorithms, revealing rigid relative displacements of the domains and the absence of microscopic strain away from the IDBs. More generally, this method oﬀers an accurate inner view of the displacements and strain of interacting defects inside small crystals that may alter optoelectronic properties of semiconductor devices.},

   abstract = {Catalysis is at the core of almost every established and emerging chemical process and also plays a central role in the quest for novel technologies for the sustainable production and conversion of energy. Particularly since the early 2000s, a great surge of interest exists in the design and application of micro- and nanometer-sized materials with hollow interiors as solid catalysts. This review provides an updated and critical survey of the ever-expanding material architectures and applications of hollow structures in all branches of catalysis, including bio-, electro-, and photocatalysis. First, the main synthesis strategies toward hollow materials are succinctly summarized, with emphasis on the (regioselective) incorporation of various types of catalytic functionalities within their diﬀerent subunits. The principles underlying the scientiﬁc and technological interest in hollow materials as solid catalysts, or catalyst carriers, are then comprehensively reviewed. Aspects covered include the stabilization of catalysts by encapsulation, the introduction of molecular sieving or stimuli-responsive “auxiliary” functionalities, as well as the single-particle, spatial compartmentalization of various catalytic functions to create multifunctional (bio)catalysts. Examples are also given on the applications which hollow structures ﬁnd in the emerging ﬁelds of electro- and photocatalysis, particularly in the context of the sustainable production of chemical energy carriers. Finally, a critical perspective is provided on the plausible evolution lines for this thriving scientiﬁc ﬁeld, as well as the main practical challenges relevant to the reproducible and scalable synthesis and utilization of hollow micro- and nanostructures as solid catalysts.},

   abstract = {The primary route to hydrogen production from fossil fuels involves the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction, and an improvement in the efficiency of WGS catalysts could therefore lead to a major leap forward in the realization of hydrogen economy. On the basis of a combination of high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we suggest the existence of a new thermodynamically stable Cu/Pt near-surface alloy (NSA). Temperature-programmed desorption and DFT reveal that this Cu/Pt NSA binds CO significantly more weakly than does Pt alone, thereby implying a considerable reduction in the potential for CO poisoning of the Cu/Pt NSA surface as compared to that of pure Pt. In addition, DFT calculations show that this Cu/Pt NSA is able to activate H2O easily, which is the rate-determining step for the WGS on several metal surfaces, and, at the same time, to bind the products of that reaction and formate intermediates rather weakly, thus avoiding possible poisoning of the catalyst surface. The Cu/Pt NSA is thus a promising candidate for an improved WGS catalyst.},

Albeit with various advantages of CDI based on synchrotrons and newly developed x-ray free electron lasers, its applications would be limited without improving resolution well below 10 nm. Here, we review the issues and efforts in improving CDI resolution including various methods for resolution determination. Enhancing diffraction signal at large diffraction angles, with the aid of interference between neighboring strong scatterers or templates, is reviewed and discussed in terms of increasing signal-tonoise ratio. In addition, we discuss errors in image reconstruction algorithms—caused by the discreteness of the Fourier transformations involved—which degrade the spatial resolution, and suggest ways to correct them. We expect this review to be useful for applications of CDI in imaging weakly scattering soft matters using coherent x-ray sources including x-ray free electron lasers.},

In this report, we will introduce the principles of forward scattering CDI and Bragg geometry CDI (BCDI), with an emphasis on the latter. BCDI exploits the ultra-high sensitivity of the diffraction pattern to the distortions of crystalline lattice. Its ability of imaging strain on the nanometer scale in three dimensions is highly novel. We will present the latest progress on the application of BCDI in investigating the strain relaxation behavior in nanoscale patterned strained silicon-on-insulator (sSOI) materials, aiming to understand and engineer strain for the design and implementation of new generation semiconductor devices.},

   abstract = {Coherent x-ray diffraction imaging is used to measure diffraction patterns from individual highly defective nanowires, showing a complex speckle pattern instead of well-defined Bragg peaks. The approach is tested for nanowires of 500 nm diameter and 500 nm height predominately composed by zinc-blende (ZB) and twinned zinc-blende (TZB) phase domains. Phase retrieval is used to reconstruct the measured 2-dimensional intensity patterns recorded from single nanowires with 3.48 nm and 0.98 nm spatial resolution. Whereas the speckle amplitudes and distribution are perfectly reconstructed, no unique solution could be obtained for the phase structure. The number of phase switches is found to be proportional to the number of measured speckles and follows a narrow number distribution. Using data with 0.98 nm spatial resolution the mean number of phase switches is in reasonable agreement with estimates taken from TEM. However, since the resolved phase domain still is 3–4 times larger than a single GaAs bilayer we explain the non-ambiguous phase reconstruction by the fact that depending on starting phase and sequence of subroutines used during the phase retrieval the retrieved phase domain host a different sequence of randomly stacked bilayers. Modelling possible arrangements of bilayer sequences within a phase domain demonstrate that the complex speckle patterns measured can indeed be explained by the random arrangement of the ZB and TZB phase domains.},

Diffraction amplitudes in the vicinity of GaAs 111 and GaAs 333 reflections were used to reconstruct the lost phase information. It is demonstrated that the structure of the core–shell–shell nanowire can be identified by means of phase contrast. Interestingly, it is found that both scattered intensity in the (111) plane and the reconstructed scattering phase show an additional threefold symmetry superimposed with the shape function of the investigated hexagonal nanowires. In order to find the origin of this threefold symmetry, elasticity calculations were performed using the finite element method and subsequent kinematic diffraction simulations. These suggest that a non-hexagonal (In,Ga)As shell covering the hexagonal GaAs core might be responsible for the observation.},

We present a nondestructive study of a single 400 nm-thick InGaN/GaN core–shell nanowire using two-dimensional (2D) X-ray Bragg ptychography (XBP) with a nanofocused X-ray beam. The XBP reconstruction enabled the determination of a detailed three-dimensional (3D) distribution of the strain in the particular nanowire using a model based on finite element method. We observed the strain induced by the lattice mismatch between the GaN core and InGaN shell to be in the range from -0.1\% to 0.15\% for an In concentration of 30\%. The maximum value of the strain component normal to the facets was concentrated at the transition region between the main part of the nanowire and the GaN tip. In addition, a variation in misfit strain relaxation between the axial growth and in-plane directions was revealed.},

Partial Patterson functions were extracted from the diffracted intensity measured along the [000{\textbackslash}bar\{1\}] direction in the vicinity of the wurtzite 00{\textbackslash}bar\{1\}{\textbackslash}bar\{5\} Bragg peak. The maxima of the Patterson function encode both the distances between the fault planes and the type of the fault planes with the sensitivity of a single atomic bilayer.

However, nanoscale to microscale variations in structure, composition, and strain within a given nanowire, as well as variations between nanowires, pose challenges to correlating microstructure with device performance. In this work, we utilize coherent nanofocused X-rays to characterize stacking defects and strain in a single InGaAs nanowire supported on Si. By reconstructing diffraction patterns from the 21̅1̅0 Bragg peak, we show that the lattice orientation varies along the length of the wire, while the strain field along the cross-section is largely unaffected, leaving the band structure unperturbed. Diffraction patterns from the 011̅0 Bragg peak are reproducibly reconstructed to create three-dimensional images of stacking defects and associated lattice strains, revealing sharp planar boundaries between different crystal phases of wurtzite (WZ) structure that contribute to charge carrier scattering. Phase retrieval is made possible by developing multiangle Bragg projection ptychography (maBPP) to accommodate coherent nanodiffraction patterns measured at arbitrary overlapping positions at multiple angles about a Bragg peak, eliminating the need for scan registration at different angles. The penetrating nature of X-ray radiation, together with the relaxed constraints of maBPP, will enable the in operando imaging of nanowire devices.},

The construction of ID16B was driven by research areas with major scientific and societal impact such as nanotechnology, earth and environmental sciences, and bio-medical research. Based on a canted undulator source, this long beamline provides hard X-ray nanobeams optimized mainly for spectroscopic applications, including the combination of X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, X-ray excited optical luminescence, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and 2D/3D X-ray imaging techniques. Its end-station re-uses part of the apparatus of the earlier ID22 beamline, while improving and enlarging the spectroscopic capabilities: for example, the experimental arrangement offers improved lateral spatial resolution (∼50 nm), a larger and more flexible capability for in situ experiments, and monochromatic nanobeams tunable over a wider energy range which now includes the hard X-ray regime (5–70 keV). This paper describes the characteristics of this new facility, short-term technical developments and the first scientific results.},

Variations in the wire diameter are massively reduced for boron doping, and cannot be measured at 600 °C for phosphorous over several tens of micrometers. This remarkable feature is accompanied by a frozen gold migration from the catalyst, with no noticeable levels of gold clusters observed using scanning electron microscopy. A detailed study of the apparent resistivity of the NWs reveals that the dopant incorporation is effective for both types of doping. A graph linking the apparent resistivity to the dopant to silane dilution ratio is built for both types of doping and discussed in the frame of the previous results.},

Within this context, scanning X-ray diffraction microscopy has become a routine technique, giving access to structural properties with sub-micrometre resolution. This article presents an optimized technique and an associated software package which have been implemented at the ID01 beamline (ESRF, Grenoble). A structural scanning probe microscope with intriguing imaging qualities is obtained. The technique consists in a two-dimensional quick continuous mapping with sub-micrometre resolution of a sample at a given reciprocal space position. These real space maps are made by continuously moving the sample while recording scattering images with a fast two-dimensional detector for every point along a rocking curve. Five-dimensional data sets are then produced, consisting of millions of detector images. The images are processed by the user-friendly X-ray strain orientation calculation software (XSOCS), which has been developed at ID01 for automatic analysis. It separates tilt and strain and generates two-dimensional maps of these parameters. At spatial resolutions of typically 200–800 nm, this quick imaging technique achieves strain sensitivity below Δa/a = 10-5 and a resolution of tilt variations down to 10-3° over a field of view of 100 × 100 µm.},

For core/shell nanowires (NWs), theoretical predictions of the coherency limits and the implications they carry remain uncertain without proper identification of the mechanisms by which strains relax. We present here for the Ge/Si core/shell NW system the first experimental measurement of critical shell thickness for strain relaxation in a semiconductor NW heterostructure and the identification of the relaxation mechanisms. Axial and tangential strain relief is initiated by the formation of periodic a/2 ⟨110⟩ perfect dislocations via nucleation and glide on \{111\} slip-planes. Glide of dislocation segments is directly confirmed by real-time in situ transmission electron microscope observations and by dislocation dynamics simulations. Further shell growth leads to roughening and grain formation which provides additional strain relief. As a consequence of core/shell strain sharing in NWs, a 16 nm radius Ge NW with a 3 nm Si shell is shown to accommodate 3\% coherent strain at equilibrium, a factor of 3 increase over the 1 nm equilibrium critical thickness for planar Si/Ge heteroepitaxial growth.},

However, the studies of “slow” dynamics in polymeric materials still remain in question due to the characteristics of the XFEL beam and concerns about sample damage. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of measuring the relaxation dynamics of gold nanoparticles suspended in polymer melts using X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS), while also monitoring eventual X-ray induced damage. In spite of inherently large pulse-to-pulse intensity and position variations of the XFEL beam, measurements can be realized at slow time scales. The X-ray induced damage and heating are less than initially expected for soft matter materials.},

VOLUME = {11},
YEAR = {2021},

ISSN = {2073-4352},
ABSTRACT = {The simultaneous measurement of two Bragg reflections by Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction is demonstrated on a twinned Au crystal, which was prepared by the solid-state dewetting of a 30 nm thin gold film on a sapphire substrate. The crystal was oriented on a goniometer so that two lattice planes fulfill the Bragg condition at the same time. The Au 111 and Au 200 Bragg peaks were measured simultaneously by scanning the energy of the incident X-ray beam and recording the diffraction patterns with two two-dimensional detectors. While the former Bragg reflection is not sensitive to the twin boundary, which is oriented parallel to the crystal–substrate interface, the latter reflection is only sensitive to one part of the crystal. The volume ratio between the two parts of the twinned crystal is about 1:9, which is also confirmed by Laue microdiffraction of the same crystal. The parallel measurement of multiple Bragg reflections is essential for future in situ and operando studies, which are so far limited to either a single Bragg reflection or several in series, to facilitate the precise monitoring of both the strain field and defects during the application of external stimuli.},

For instance, accelerators are able to generate 3 PB data just in one experiment. Synchrotrons industry is an example of the volume and velocity of data which data is too big to be analyzed at once. While some light sources can deal with 11 PB, they confront with data problems. The explosion of data become an important and serious issue in today's synchrotrons world. Totally, these data problems pose in different fields like storage, analytics, visualisation, monitoring and controlling. To override these problems, they prefer HDF5, grid computing, cloud computing and Hadoop/Hbase and NoSQL. Recently, bigdata takes a lot of attention from academic and industry places. We are looking for an appropriate and feasible solution for data issues in ILSF basically.

   abstract = {The rapid development of synchrotrons has massively increased the speed at which experiments can be performed, while new techniques have increased the amount of raw data collected during each experiment. While this has created enormous new opportunities, it has also created tremendous challenges for national facilities and users. With the huge increase in data volume, the manual analysis of data is no longer possible. As a result, only a fraction of the data collected during the time- and money-expensive synchrotron beam-time is analyzed and used to deliver new science. Additionally, the lack of an appropriate data analysis environment limits the realization of experiments that generate a large amount of data in a very short period of time. The current lack of automated data analysis pipelines prevents the fine-tuning of beam-time experiments, further reducing their potential usage. These effects, collectively known as the “data deluge,” affect synchrotrons in several different ways including fast data collection, available local storage, data management systems, and curation of the data. This review highlights the Big Data strategies adopted nowadays at synchrotrons, documenting this novel and promising hybridization between science and technology, which promise a dramatic increase in the number of scientific discoveries.},

It takes researchers a long time going through different results from generalized search engines to find their needed scientific information so that the design of a domain specific search engine can help researchers to find their desired information with greater precision. It also provides the opportunity to use the crawled data to create a knowledgebase and also to generate different datasets required by the researchers. There have been several other vertical search engines that are designed for scientific data search such as medical information. In this paper we propose the design of such search engine on top of the Apache Hadoop framework. Usage of Hadoop ecosystem provides the necessary features such as scalability, fault tolerance and availability. It also abstracts the complexities of search engine design by using different open source tools as building blocks, among them Apache Nutch for the crawling block and Apache Solr for indexing and query processing. Our primary results obtained by implementing the proposed method in single node mode, the index of over a hundred thousand pages was created with the average fetch interval of 30 days having 28 segments and approximately 570MB size.

It is therefore unnecessary to oversample the magnitude of Fourier transforms by 2⫻ in each dimension (i.e., oversampling by 4⫻ for 2D and 8⫻ for 3D) in retrieving the phase of 2D and 3D objects. Our computer phasing experiments accurately retrieved the phase from the magnitude of the Fourier transforms of 2D and 3D complex-valued objects by using positivity constraints on the imaginary part of the objects and loose supports, with the oversampling factor much less than 4 for 2D and 8 for 3D objects. Under the same conditions we also obtained reasonably good reconstruc- tions of 2D and 3D complex-valued objects from the magnitude of their Fourier transforms with added noise and a central stop},

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been found to be efficient on SARS-CoV-2, and reported to be efficient in Chinese COV-19 patients. We evaluate the effect of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads.
Patients and methods
French Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16th, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point.
Results
Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported in the litterature for untreated patients. Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination.
Conclusion
Despite its small sample size, our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin.}

   abstract = {Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging (BCDI) has emerged as a powerful technique to image the local displacement field and strain in nanocrystals, in three dimensions with nanometric spatial resolution. However, BCDI relies on both dataset collection and phase retrieval algorithms that can induce artefacts in the reconstruction. Phase retrieval algorithms are based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT). We demonstrate how to calculate the displacement field inside a nanocrystal from its reconstructed phase depending on the mathematical convention used for the FFT. We use numerical simulations to quantify the influence of experimentally unavoidable detector deficiencies such as blind areas or limited dynamic range as well as post-processing filtering on the reconstruction. We also propose a criterion for the isosurface determination of the object, based on the histogram of the reconstructed modulus. Finally, we study the capability of the phasing algorithm to quantitatively retrieve the surface strain (i.e., the strain of the surface voxels). This work emphasizes many aspects that have been neglected so far in BCDI, which need to be understood for a quantitative analysis of displacement and strain based on this technique. It concludes with the optimization of experimental parameters to improve throughput and to establish BCDI as a reliable 3D nano-imaging technique.},

In particular, by means of linear combination fit of the XANES spectra, the notebook determines the chemical species distribution in the sample under investigation. The direct output of the analysis process is the correlation between the different elemental distributions and the spatial localization of the chemical species detected.

   abstract = {X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) is becoming an extremely popular tool for material science thanks to the development of new synchrotron radiation light sources. It provides information about charge state and local geometry around atoms of interest in operando and extreme conditions. However, in contrast to X-ray diffraction, a quantitative analysis of XANES spectra is rarely performed in the research papers. The reason must be found in the larger amount of time required for the calculation of a single spectrum compared to a diffractogram. For such time-consuming calculations, in the space of several structural parameters, we developed an interpolation approach proposed originally by Smolentsev and Soldatov (2007). The current version of this software, named PyFitIt, is a major upgrade version of FitIt and it is based on machine learning algorithms. We have chosen Jupyter Notebook framework to be friendly for users and at the same time being available for remastering. The analytical work is divided into two steps. First, the series of experimental spectra are analyzed statistically and decomposed into principal components. Second, pure spectral profiles, recovered by principal components, are fitted by theoretical interpolated spectra. We implemented different schemes of choice of nodes for approximation and learning algorithms including Gradient Boosting of Random Trees, Radial Basis Functions and Neural Networks. The fitting procedure can be performed both for a XANES spectrum or for a difference spectrum, thus minimizing the systematic errors of theoretical simulations. The problem of several local minima is addressed in the framework of direct and indirect approaches. Program summary: Program title: PyFitIt. Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/ydkgfdc38t.1 Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License 3. Programming language: Python, Jupyter Notebook framework. Nature of problem: Quantitative structural refinements of the X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectra (XANES). Identification of the pure spectral and concentration profiles associated with an experimental XANES dataset. Solution method: The fitting procedure of the experimental XANES spectra or of their differences is realized by means of the inverse and direct approaches based on the training set and approximation machine learning algorithms. The spectral resolution method is based on the PCA technique involving the usage of a target transformation matrix. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: The current version is compatible with the free FDMNES program package for XANES simulations. However, users can prepare their own matrices of spectra calculated by an arbitrary software and the corresponding structural parameters to perform the fitting procedure in PyFitIt. The complete set of examples is distributed along with the program. References: PyFitIt web page: http://hpc.nano.sfedu.ru/pyfitit/},

The control of structural and compositional homogeneity of these semiconductor heterostructures is the key to success to further develop these state-of-the-art technologies. In this article, we report on the lateral distribution of tilt, composition, and strain across step-graded SiGe strain relaxed buffer layers on 300 mm Si(001) wafers treated with and without chemical–mechanical polishing. By using the advanced synchrotron based scanning X-ray diffraction microscopy technique K-Map together with micro-Raman spectroscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy, we are able to establish a partial correlation between real space morphology and structural properties of the sample resolved at the micrometer scale. In particular, we demonstrate that the lattice plane bending of the commonly observed cross-hatch pattern is caused by dislocations. Our results show a strong local correlation between the strain field and composition distribution, indicating that the adatom surface diffusion during growth is driven by strain field fluctuations induced by the underlying dislocation network. Finally, it is revealed that a superficial chemical–mechanical polishing of cross-hatched surfaces does not lead to any significant change of tilt, composition, and strain variation compared to that of as-grown samples.},

The Fourier shell correlation (FSC) criterion has now become the standard quality measure. However, what has continued to be controversial is the issue of the FSC threshold level at which one defines the reproducible resolution. Here, we discuss the theoretical behaviour of the FSC in conjunction with the various factors which influence it: the number of “voxels” in a given Fourier shell, the symmetry of the structure, and the size of the structure within the reconstruction volume. Both the theoretical considerations and our model experiments show that fixed-valued FSC threshold (like “0.5”) may never be used in a reproducible criterion. Fixed threshold values are—as we show here—simply the result of incorrect assumptions in the basic statistics. Two families of FSC threshold curves are discussed: the σ-factor curves and the new family of bit-based information threshold curves. Whereas σ-factor curves indicate the resolution level at which one has collected information significantly above the noise level, the information curves indicate the resolution level at which enough information has been collected for interpretation.},

   abstract = {Electrocatalysis is at the heart of a broad range of physicochemical applications that play an important role in the present and future of a sustainable economy. Among the myriad of different electrocatalysts used in this field, nanomaterials are of ubiquitous importance. An increased surface area/volume ratio compared to bulk makes nanoscale catalysts the preferred choice to perform electrocatalytic reactions. Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) was introduced in 2006 and since has been applied to obtain 3D images of crystalline nanomaterials. BCDI provides information about the displacement field, which is directly related to strain. Lattice strain in the catalysts impacts their electronic configuration and, consequently, their binding energy with reaction intermediates. Even though there have been significant improvements since its birth, the fact that the experiments can only be performed at synchrotron facilities and its relatively low resolution to date (∼10 nm spatial resolution) have prevented the popularization of this technique. Herein, we will briefly describe the fundamentals of the technique, including the electrocatalysis relevant information that we can extract from it. Subsequently, we review some of the computational experiments that complement the BCDI data for enhanced information extraction and improved understanding of the underlying nanoscale electrocatalytic processes. We next highlight success stories of BCDI applied to different electrochemical systems and in heterogeneous catalysis to show how the technique can contribute to future studies in electrocatalysis. Finally, we outline current challenges in spatiotemporal resolution limits of BCDI and provide our perspectives on recent developments in synchrotron facilities as well as the role of machine learning and artificial intelligence in addressing them.},

abstract = {Defects can affect all aspects of a material by altering its electronic properties and controlling its chemical reactivity. At defect sites, preferential adsorption of reactants and/or formation of chemical species at active sites are observed in heterogeneous catalysis. Understanding the structural response at defect sites during catalytic reactions provides a unique opportunity to exploit defect control of nanoparticle-based catalysts. However, it remains difficult to characterize the strain and defect evolution for a single nanocrystal catalyst in situ. Here, we report Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging of defect dynamics in an individual Pt nanoparticle during catalytic methane oxidation. We observed that the initially tensile strained regions of the crystal became seed points for the development of further strain and subsequent disappearance of diffraction density during oxidation reactions. Our detailed understanding of the catalytically induced deformation at the defect sites and observed reversibility during the relevant steps of the catalytic oxidation process provide important insights of defect control and engineering of heterogeneous catalysts.},

abstract = {Sampling the diffraction pattern of a finite specimen more finely than the Nyquist frequency (the inverse of the size of the diffracting specimen) corresponds to surrounding the electron density of the specimen with a no-density region. When the no-density region is bigger than the electron-density region, sufficient information is recorded so that the phase information can be retrieved from the oversampled diffraction pattern, at least in principle. By employing an iterative algorithm, the phase information from the oversampled diffraction pattern of a micrometre-sized test specimen has been successfully retrieved. This method is believed to be able to open a door for high-resolution three-dimensional structure determination of complex and non-crystalline biological specimens, i.e. whole cells and sub-micrometre molecular clusters and micrometre-sized protein crystals. With the possible appearance in the future of X-ray free-electron lasers, it may become possible to image single molecules by recording diffraction patterns before radiation damage manifests itself.},

By manipulating a tightly focussed beam of energetic ions, often gallium (Ga+), FIB can sculpt nanostructures via localised sputtering. This ability to cut solid matter on the nano-scale revolutionised sample preparation across the life, earth and materials sciences. Despite its widespread usage, detailed understanding of the FIB-induced structural damage, intrinsic to the technique, remains elusive. Here we examine the defects caused by FIB in initially pristine objects. Using Bragg Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging (BCDI), we are able to spatially-resolve the full lattice strain tensor in FIB-milled gold nano-crystals. We find that every use of FIB causes large lattice distortions. Even very low ion doses, typical of FIB imaging and previously thought negligible, have a dramatic effect. Our results are consistent with a damage microstructure dominated by vacancies, highlighting the importance of free-surfaces in determining which defects are retained. At larger ion fluences, used during FIB-milling, we observe an extended dislocation network that causes stresses far beyond the bulk tensile strength of gold. These observations provide new fundamental insight into the nature of the damage created and the defects that lead to a surprisingly inhomogeneous morphology.},

Also, we provide an algorithm for automatic alignment of projections that has good performance even for samples with no fiducial markers. Currently applied to phase projections, this alignment algorithm has proven to be robust and should also be useful for lens-based tomography techniques that pursue nanoscale 3D imaging. Lastly, we provide a method for tomographic reconstruction that works on phase projections that are known modulo 2π, such that the phase unwrapping step is avoided. We demonstrate the performance of these algorithms by 3D imaging of bacteria population in legume root-nodule cells.},

Typical phase retrieval algorithms are iterative in nature, and hence, are time-consuming and computationally expensive, making real-time imaging a challenge. Furthermore, iterative phase retrieval algorithms struggle to converge to the correct solution especially in the presence of strong phase structures. In this work, we demonstrate the training and testing of CDI NN, a pair of deep deconvolutional networks trained to predict structure and phase in real space of a 2D object from its corresponding far-field diffraction intensities alone. Once trained, CDI NN can invert a diffraction pattern to an image within a few milliseconds of compute time on a standard desktop machine, opening the door to real-time imaging.},

The current process of phase recovery is iterative in nature. As a result, the image formation is time consuming and computationally expensive, precluding real-time imaging. Here, we use 3D nanoscale X-ray imaging as a representative example to develop a deep learning model to address this phase retrieval problem. We introduce 3D-CDINN, a deep convolutional neural network and differential programing framework trained to predict 3D structure and strain, solely from input 3D X-ray coherent scattering data. Our networks are designed to be “physics-aware” in multiple aspects; in that the physics of the X-ray scattering process is explicitly enforced in the training of the network, and the training data are drawn from atomistic simulations that are representative of the physics of the material. We further reﬁne the neural network prediction through a physics-based optimization procedure to enable maximum accuracy at lowest computational cost. 3D-CDI-NN can invert a 3D coherent diffraction pattern to real-space structure and strain hundreds of times faster than traditional iterative phase retrieval methods. Our integrated machine learning and differential programing solution to the phase retrieval problem is broadly applicable across inverse problems in other application areas.},
